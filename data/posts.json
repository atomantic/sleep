    "content": "<p>The story/memory below is a repost from my daddy-blog, Sleep Deprivation Ninja, pulled from <a href=\"http://sleepdepninja.blogspot.com/search/label/Ninja%20as%20Child\">the Ninja as Child stories</a>. A recent event has sparked the need to revisit this memory. This is the only thing I can leave for my daughter on this topic&#8211;my own personal experience. I was hoping she would be older before having to learn about this side of humanity&#8211;and I think even now, at nearly 5, no child is really able to fully grok the concept. It just flat out doesn&#8217;t make sense. There&#8217;s no reason they should understand it&#8211;but here it is.</p>\n<p>The below is a true account of my childhood as I remember it, as are all of the Ninja as Child stories on that other blog&#8211;these are some of my most vivid memories because of their intensity. I spent many nights staring at the ceiling of my bedroom, reliving them, thinking how life might have been different, if there was anything I could have changed&#8230;<br />\n&#8212;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know who Jon Bon Jovi is!?&#8221; This came from Izaak, the 7-year-old kid standing in front of me, wearing a leather jacket with a big &#8220;Jon Bon Jovi&#8221; spread across the back.</p>\n<p>I had, of course, in my ignorance, dared to ask him, &#8220;Who is Jon Bon Jovi?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Queue music:</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SRvCvsRp5ho\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>We are all standing in line, awaiting our release from our second grade classroom, into the open embrace of recess. I look at Izaak who has only half way turned around to give me the same face the Fonz would use to tell someone, &#8220;hey, it&#8217;s cool, I&#8217;m cool enough for the two of us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Izaak <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">is </span>cool enough for the two of us. He is a certifiable badass. This kid knows everything that is cool. He&#8217;s slick with the ladies. He can always win those toys from the stupid claw machines at the video arcade. Every. Freaking. Time. Sometimes we go to the video arcade at the mall just so he can prove it.</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;m standing there, turning red with embarrassment that I don&#8217;t have a clue who this Bon Jovi guy is and Izaak saves me. He leans in and whispers, &#8220;he&#8217;s a singer, man.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh. Oh, yeah, I knew that.&#8221; I&#8217;m such a smart-ass. Izaak shakes his head, totally not falling for my ruse. &#8220;You going to Mike&#8217;s birthday party tonight?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes I am.&#8221; He says and then he throws his hands into the air in a badass biker style &#8220;ROCK&#8221; just as the bell rings. For a split second it looks like he made the bells ring just by throwing his arms up and giving the signal. I marvel until the vanishing line catches up with my position.</p>\n<p>Children pour out into the play yard like a bag full of marbles spilling out onto the floor. Direction is meaningless. Vectors change based only on the terrain. Individuals coalesce into groups, arbitrarily merged based on location, rather than social status. The hordes of children indulge only in fun.</p>\n<p>Mike&#8217;s birthday party that night begins at Angelo&#8217;s Pizza. There are about eight of us running amuck, pizza in one hand and a fistful of quarters for the video games in the other. Several very large pizza&#8217;s are quickly devoured. My stack of quarters lasts me about fifteen minutes. Some other kids have more and I watch as they play. Izaak has been playing for over thirty minutes on the quarter he borrowed from Mike. Badass. Within the hour, all the quarters are gone and Izaak has killed the game. This place is spent. But the night is still young. The party continues at Mike&#8217;s house, where we will all slumber over, living the fort-building, pillow-fighting, video-game addicted paradise.</p>\n<p>When we get to Mike&#8217;s house, I look around at all my cohorts and something isn&#8217;t right. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Izaak?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mike shrugs, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8230; I think he had to take off or something.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Man that sucks.&#8221; I&#8217;m a little hurt. How could he ditch out on the best part. A sleepover! That&#8217;s just crazy. I&#8217;m sad for a brief moment but little boys with their toys and games are easily distracted and fooled. We all forget about Izaak.</p>\n<p>The next morning, my mother picks me up and she asks me how it went. &#8220;Oh, we made this awesome fort and played video games and ate lots of junk food and it was fun. I wish Izaak was there. Do you know why he didn&#8217;t come?&#8221;</p>\n<p>My mother stares out the window of the car as we drive away. She looks unusually distant. &#8220;I drove Izaak home last night from the pizza place.&#8221; Then she looks at me with a pained expression like she is about to cry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why, what happened?&#8221; I&#8217;m scared for Izaak. Did he get injured or something? Did he have some kind of emergency?</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mike&#8217;s mother told me she didn&#8217;t want him there because Izaak is black.&#8221; She looks at me. I&#8217;m at a total loss for words. &#8220;She said, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I don&#8217;t want that negro boy staying at my house with my son.</span> That&#8217;s what she told me. So I took Izaak and I drove him home and I explained it to his parents&#8230;. I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221; She turns back to the road.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mom! Why didn&#8217;t you tell me? Why did you let me go there? I wouldn&#8217;t have gone if I knew that.&#8221; I start to get angry, brooding with my arms folded tight.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I should have told you. I regret not telling you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t stay mad at my mother. I stare out the window and I imagine that I am Izaak, sitting here in the passenger seat, being driven home from the party. Did he cry? I wonder, did this happen to him a lot? I had no idea someone would ever do something like that to him. Why? WTF? Why?</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Fuck. Now </span><span style=\"color: #3366ff; font-style: italic;\">I&#8217;m</span><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"> fighting the tears just remembering this shit. And yes, ninjas do cry, but it only happens when a ninja relives some of the tragic memories that eventually combined to create the need to become Ninja. I can still choke a Jabberwock with my pinky.</span></p>\n<p>Izaak just keeps cool. On Monday, in class, he just shruggs like the Fonz when Mike and the others ask him what happened to him. &#8220;Hey, I just had to go, you know.&#8221; Izaak didn&#8217;t miss a beat. Mike doesn&#8217;t even know his own mother is a racist bitch.</p>\n<p>I look around the classroom. Tiffany has red hair. Brian&#8217;s hair is black. I have extreme blue eyes, about which the teacher makes frequent creepy comments. I&#8217;m the only one in the class with eyes this blue. Tiffany is the only one with red hair. Izaak has really dark skin. It&#8217;s darker than peter&#8217;s and in a different way. Everyone&#8217;s hair is different. Everyone&#8217;s eyes are different. Our noses are different, our chins, our height, the size of our hands. Everyone has a different skin tone. The only thing we see in each other is difference. And difference is cool.</p>\n<p>This classroom is full of hippie children. Most of our parents were hippies. Some still are. We live in a little town full of natural food stores and local bars where everybody knows your name. In this town of monotonous living, conformity is tantamount to wearing a shirt that says &#8216;Dull&#8217;. So we all look at each other for the differences that make us cool, all trying not to blend in with anyone else. Until we get around to learning about discrimination in school, none of us has any idea the world is full of such things. Sure, we notice we are all different but by what scale could we even dare to label any of these traits better than others? The only thing that matters is that you know who the fuck Jon Bon Jovi is. That&#8217;s definitive.</p>\n<p>Many years later, I&#8217;m about 15 years old now, and I&#8217;m at the grocery store getting a bunch of stuff for my mom. When it&#8217;s my turn in line, I unload a full cart of food onto the conveyor belt and when I look up, I recognize the woman at the register. It&#8217;s Mike&#8217;s mom. She&#8217;s older but she still looks the same. I remember Izaak and as I think about him, recognition dawns in her face too. She knows who I am. She knows I was friends with both her son and with Izaak. I think about screaming at her or just casually asking her what it&#8217;s like to hate people like Izaak for such stupid reasons. I look behind me and see that the line is long. Everyone is waiting for my heap of goods to be purchased so they can take my place and interact with this woman.</p>\n<p>No, not this woman. I look at the ground and lick my lips, clenching my fists, ready to bash her face in while she&#8217;s calmly beep-beeping my groceries. I look up at her and slowly shake my head. I can&#8217;t do this. I can&#8217;t make this transaction.</p>\n<p>I leave. I just walk out. The pile of groceries sits on the conveyor belt and yields to no one. She doesn&#8217;t say anything. I know as I leave the store that she is just staring at my back and she knows exactly why. It&#8217;s not much resolution but at 15, I am not yet a ninja. I&#8217;m still just a little boy who doesn&#8217;t understand the world. Not even a little.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Damn. That was the saddest stroll down memory lane I&#8217;ve taken in a while. I&#8217;m getting all of these memories written so I can remember them when I&#8217;m old and so my daughter can have an idea what the world was like when I was a kid. I had forgotten when I started this project that so many of the memories that stuck are pretty shitty. I&#8217;ve got a million more. But that&#8217;s why I eventually cracked and became Ninja. Time for something to laugh at. This seems relevant:</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HuM2H6uFG2M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>He&#8217;s crazy. This PhD student we&#8217;ve got in our place. Granted, we are living underground, in an abandoned missile silo, so we all have our eccentricities. But this guy has really lost it. We think he&#8217;s acquired a real missile&#8211;a fucking nuclear powered atomic bomb thingy. He keeps playing with the control room, like he&#8217;s setting up for something.</p>\n<p>Days later:<br />\nHe&#8217;s done it. This place is on lockdown. There&#8217;s apparently no way to stop the bomb. The whole system is rigged on a death-lock. If anyone tries to tamper with it, the missile goes off immediately. We&#8217;re certain he&#8217;s got it aimed at Moscow. He&#8217;s going to trigger the doomsday scenario. He&#8217;s on some kind of &#8216;world must reset itself&#8217; binge. Bunch of fucking philosophy major bullshit. The whole world knows. It&#8217;s on the news. NATO was alerted that a formerly deactivated launch center has triggered an offensive attack and it&#8217;s gong down in the next two hours. Seems like a long time. Maybe the government will be able to break into the silo and stop this thing. Maybe they have a backdoor into the system and they can stop it for real. I&#8217;m kidding myself, of course.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not certain but I suspect he thinks the russian defense system won&#8217;t work, like it&#8217;ll be delayed a few hours in responding. Just enough time for the US of fucking A to take full offensive and finish the job in fear of the final retaliation. He thinks some people will survive this thing. We don&#8217;t even try to argue the ecological impact that will undoubtably carry radiation and death to every door of the world. Even if half the world is destroyed. We are all members of a fragile web. He&#8217;s fucking with the web.</p>\n<p>The radios are all scatter-cast. They hiss and jibe in a frenzy with broken reports and speculation. The World is onto this place. Everyone is kissing their loved ones. Ready for the end of the world.</p>\n<p>He likes me. Some kind of comrade in arms thing. We&#8217;re bunkmates, telling stories of our childhood and fucked up upbringing. We know each other&#8217;s secrets. I should have known he&#8217;d go ballistic on the entire world. But he has some kind of escape mechanism.</p>\n<p>We are going to the moon. He&#8217;s got this advanced military device that can teleport (or some crazy science) us to the moon in no time. I don&#8217;t know what to say but he&#8217;s invited me to watch the end of the world on some odd little secret military base with him. Before I know it, we are beach-towel-laying on the moon, just outside of the base station, staring at Earth and the whole thing just looks so sad and fragile. I ask him about space suits and he says he didn&#8217;t have time to pack them but the air filtration and ventilation system inside the base will allow us to breath outside within 20 feet of the entrance. It&#8217;s just blasting us with oxygen, faster than the void of space can rip it away from us. My hair is in a permanent wind gust pattern the likes of which Morrissey has never known.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got to get back home. This moon-base is freaking me out. It&#8217;s a dome that looks like something out of a James Bond casino scene. There&#8217;s a Jukebox and a sassy waitress, booze and billiards. I feel like throwing up. I jump for the transporter while his back is turned.<br />\nOne of my housemates reminds me that I have an experiment brewing. It&#8217;s a form of nano-machine powered ectoplasmic fluid that will melt through just about anything, even heated enriched uranium, releasing safe, eco-friendly waste into the air. The missile is right in front of me and I drizzle the beakers all over it. The cap melts, revealing a super-hot plasma sphere. Canisters of all kinds of deadly crap are sitting inside the missile, melting together into the ultimate weapon. I don&#8217;t know what to do but I keep splattering the fluid all over the device. The timer is ticking. It&#8217;s getting hotter in here. I can see that if I continue to eat through the material, this whole place will fill with such heat and fire that all the oxygen will burst into flames. We will all die. I prod the goo, trying to get it to work but something in it has just given up. It&#8217;s just laying there in spatters like inert spit&#8211;a worthless affront to the inevitable. Like the whole of physics has just flipped a middle finger to this crazy species.</p>\n<p>I envision the end of the world. The ecto-acid goo isn&#8217;t preventing the apocalypse. I can&#8217;t stop the timer. My flatmates are hiding themselves in self-flagellation, coming the form of last minute video game victories and alcoholic drinks&#8211;they&#8217;ve given up. I can hear the military, with their best men, banging on the top door. They want in&#8211;knowing full-well the best they can do is put a bullet in my flatmates and me. I can&#8217;t open the door from the inside. It&#8217;d be worth a try to give them a chance at stopping it. This is happening. We&#8217;re all going to die.</p>\n<p>The timer counts down and I can hear, through the distant crackles of the kitchen radio, the cries of mothers holding their young. The missile fires. We watch it go up into the air and all we can do is hold our breath.</p>\n<p>Russia has a hand on the trigger. The US has the same. Everyone ready to kill and die but not willing to fire until it&#8217;s set in stone. Thank fucking reason for that. Nobody in the face of the earth breathes for a long time.</p>\n<p>The missile keeps going. It goes up&#8211;and when it should be turning toward Russia, it doesn&#8217;t. It just keeps going up, through the atmosphere and into space, off to detonate somewhere else.</p>\n<p>I gasp for air as all the oxygen in the planet moves in and out at once.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I&#8217;ve now been trying to get <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/InZomnia-the-Graphic-Novel/182039795142286\">inZomnia</a> finished for a while (as a 12 issue volume) and I&#8217;ve been rolling this other idea around in the back of my head for almost as long. I&#8217;m not really putting off <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/InZomnia-the-Graphic-Novel/182039795142286\">inZomnia</a> but I have to admit it is an ambitious first entry into the comics space. This other idea is much simpler and allows me to create a single issue to introduce the world without worrying that later issues might need to revise the first.</p>\n<p>Something about the comics industry that I find so strange is that writers don&#8217;t usually have the full story mapped out. They might have the current arc fully bulleted (hopefully) but they typically write an issue, it goes to the artist, they write another issue, and so on. Usually this only happens with ongoing series like The Walking Dead, DMZ, The Boys etc, which are three series that have been really disappointing to me lately&#8211;I find that any series pushing past 60 issues is just going on too long. But imagine writing a novel where you write the first chapter, polished and complete, ship it off to press and then start writing the second chapter, knowing that you have no ability to revise character interactions, manners of speech, plot devices, etc in previous chapters&#8211;those are set in stone. The really minor things are what get me. Since I&#8217;ve been writing inZomnia, I&#8217;ve revised the first issue script 3 times&#8211;and they are very different versions. Perhaps it&#8217;s just an issue with having all the characters and story fully mapped&#8211;something I&#8217;m still working on&#8211;but I keep thinking of subtle things that I issue #10 or #11 will have that need a little foreshadowing earlier on. It would be a pity to press those and not have the ability to include that. So, since I&#8217;m new to this, I&#8217;m not just outlining&#8211;I&#8217;m going to at least write a prose page for each issue, fully flushing out the details before I go back to revise the actual scripts again.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, as advised by my virtual mentor Antony Johnston in his fantastic articles on writing comics, it&#8217;s good to step back and work on something else to give your brain time to come back with a fresh perspective.</p>\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with Antony&#8217;s work, he is currently writing <a href=\"http://amzn.to/g9zNr5\">Wasteland</a> and the following articles on his site are required reading for anyone wanting to write comics (or even if you are just into writing anything at all, the first article is for you):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://antonyjohnston.com/articles/gtw.php\">Getting Things Written</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://antonyjohnston.com/articles/process.php\">Antony Johnston&#8217;s Process</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://antonyjohnston.com/articles/scriveningcomics.php\">Scrivening Comics</a> (I highly recommend <a href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\">Scrivener</a> as well&#8211;it&#8217;s a beautiful writing tool for writers of all kinds&#8211;and I get no money for saying that).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, as I was saying, I took a little break today and created a 3 act outline for a 1-shot comic called &#8220;Asher Evans isn&#8217;t Real.&#8221; Of course, it&#8217;s a 1-shot that sets the stage to grow into an ongoing series or, as I prefer all media to be, a more flushed out and conclusive graphic novel. Asher Evans has a twitter account if you are interested in following the progress of a fictional character living a fictional life within his own fictional world: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AsherEvans\">http://twitter.com/AsherEvans</a></p>\n<p>Next steps with this one-shot are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Writing a prose summary for the issue</li>\n<li>Converting the prose summary into 3&#215;5 cards (using scrivener to create 22 cards that also double as script pages)</li>\n<li>Expand those cards into scripted format</li>\n<li>Find an artist to do some character sketches</li>\n</ol>\n",

    "content": "<p>Well, I&#8217;m still here, more or less.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a tough year so far in terms of finding writing time&#8211;I know everyone makes excuses so I won&#8217;t bother to drop them here. On the other hand, I&#8217;ve found a good amount of time to think about writing&#8211;and specifically think and dream about character and plot development, back-stories, panel layouts and specific sequences within my story, etc&#8230; and I&#8217;m pretty happy with what&#8217;s coming out.</p>\n<p>Currently, I&#8217;m putting off the actual script writing to spend time developing my Pitch, which includes way more details than would go into a real pitch&#8211;it&#8217;s mostly a guide for me to organize the characters, tone, audience, plot arcs, issue spines and the like. Eventually, this is what I&#8217;ll be showing to an artist who might want to join up with me to produce inZomnia. Yeah, you read it right, I won&#8217;t be drawing this graphic novel (most likely). My drawing hand is not at the place I want it to be for the look and feel of this story and I&#8217;d really like to work with an artist who has comics experience. Besides, writing comes first and it&#8217;s going to take me long enough to get that where I want it.</p>\n<p>I do terribly miss having time to myself and anyone out there who has broken into the comics scene with full-time job and a family (and specifically a 2.5 year-old), I welcome your enlightened suggestions.</p>\n<p>So, on to a brief diversion wherein I actually talk about the topic of this post:</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://amzn.to/fetWYL\" target=\"amazon\">The DC Comics Guide to Writing Comics</a>, Dennis O&#8217;Neil talks about the Levitz Paradigm, which strikes me as a simple way to organize and track multiple plots and their development within a series. Basically, as I understand it, you create a table with plots on the left (rows) and issues on the top (columns). Then you simple write out the plot spines as they develop within the issues, staggering in new plot arcs (be they subplots, major plots or diversions) as others fade away, keeping about 3-4 live plots running at any given time. By the way, I&#8217;m quite shocked that Wikipedia doesn&#8217;t have an article on the Levitz Paradigm but I&#8217;m not going to write a page for it&#8211;I&#8217;ve got enough procrastination projects.</p>\n<p>Since I sadly, did not pursue and English, Literature, Creative Writing or any related degree in college, I hadn&#8217;t given much analytical thought to the development of serial TV, comics or other forms of fiction. O&#8217;Neil&#8217;s book talks a bit about soap operas and how they keep viewers interested and I noticed that many of the TV shows on at any given moment use the same techniques&#8211;generally something that looks like the Levitz Paradigm. The core of the idea is that you can end a plot, satisfying the audience with its completion but by having other plot lines flowing unfinished, you keep them interested in whatever comes out next.</p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m really not into long, unending serials. Frankly, I&#8217;m a little disappointed with The Walking Dead, which I thought hit its peak of interest a dozen or so issues ago. When I started reading it, I didn&#8217;t expect it to go to 80 issues and beyond&#8211;and I don&#8217;t see any reason they would ever stop (it could go to hundreds of issues). I like stories that end. Endings are dear to me. But I like the idea of using the Levitz Paradigm to help me get through 12 issues (I think) of inZomnia, allowing the plots to trickle into closure toward the end.</p>\n<p>It occurred to me today that I could start writing a blog called &#8216;Code to Comics&#8217; but then I realized that if I spent the time needed to truly blogument the process I&#8217;m going through, I wouldn&#8217;t have any time to write, which is already a problem. So, I&#8217;ll leave that blog title for someone else. Really, take it. I&#8217;m going to keep this name just in case I need to experiment with sleep again (fairly likely).</p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;ll leave you with a simple list of the bedside reading I&#8217;ve been enjoying for the past several weeks&#8211;and then I&#8217;ll get my ass over to writing.</p>\n<p><a target=\"amazon\" href=\"http://amzn.to/fetWYL\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:10px\"><img height=\"150\" src=\"http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0823010279.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg\"></a><a target=\"amazon\" href=\"http://amzn.to/gHnPft\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:10px\"><img height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-130.jpg\"></a><a target=\"amazon\" href=\"http://amzn.to/hwGqxu\" style=\"display:block;float:left;margin-right:10px\"><img height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-131.jpg\"></a></p>\n<ul style=\"clear:both\">\n<li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/fetWYL\" target=\"amazon\">The DC Comics Guide to Writing Comics&#8217; by Dennis O&#8217;Neil</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/gHnPft\" target=\"amazon\">&#8216;Come In Alone&#8217; by Warren Ellis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://amzn.to/hwGqxu\" target=\"amazon\">&#8216;Writers on Comics Scriptwriting, Vol. 1&#8217; by Mark Salisbury</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

It brings out the insects. Wherever you go, the air is thick with the chirps of cicadas and the ground is swarming with beetles, ants and all kinds of other things I can&#8217;t identify.</p>\n<p>The sun sinks away, leaving behind a sunset that lasts for hours. I swear, it&#8217;s almost midnight and the sky is still a little blue.</p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m looking at the moon, which is unusually bright tonight, when this <em>thing</em> comes swirling out of a gap of light that just sort of appears in the middle of the sky. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a robot or a suit of armor for some kind of intergalactic octopus but it comes up toward me, followed by a little hovering ball that keeps bleeping and flashing little fuzzy plasma lit signals.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/atomantic/4979642760/\" title=\"data by antic, on Flickr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/img-148.jpg\" width=\"480\" height=\"640\" alt=\"data\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is when the big one speaks in a deep gargled metallic tone, telling me that Cthulu&#8217;s army is being manufactured in a nearby layer of this space-fabric-thingy and that I should prepare for the oncoming horde that will enslave all of my kind. I don&#8217;t reply right away&#8211;more like I just stare at it&#8211;which seems to cause confusion amongst my visitors. While the robot monster is looking back and forth between me and it&#8217;s little floaty ball friend, I make the loudest cicada call I can muster.</p>\n<p>The desert rises up like a tidal wave and descends.</p>\n<p>You can hear them, but until you see the swarms of desert insects combine into Optimus Megabug, you have no freaking clue how many are really out there. The exposed tentacles dangling below the hovering robot armor go first, chewed away and replaced by countless flapping wings. Flames spew out of the exhaust-pipe-looking-things on the robot&#8217;s shoulders. I don&#8217;t think they are supposed to do that. The little flying ball is totally losing it&#8217;s shit. It&#8217;s zipping around, apparently weaponless. Must just be a scout or something. It zooms back toward the horizon and vanishes into a wisp of light that peels back the sky. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to warn the others not to come or fetch reinforcements but it&#8217;s gone now.</p>\n<p>With the octopus beast eaten, all that remains is the robot shell. It&#8217;s a pretty cool piece of machinery so I cover it up in the sand, marking the position for later retrieval. Bring it on Cthulhu. Send your beasts. We&#8217;ve got insects.</p>\n",

That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m drawing tomorrow.&#8221; So today, here&#8217;s a sketch of my wife. Beware that it&#8217;s a bit rough and the mouth and eyes didn&#8217;t turn out like I wanted. I&#8217;m going to ease off portraits for a while before getting around to drawing Ilya. I want to focus on building more of a comic book style form&#8211;and get better at shading. I have no intention of drawing portraits very often anyway&#8211;I&#8217;m going through a few drawing tutorials and haven&#8217;t quite gotten to those parts yet.

When I first went to the art store in August, I didn&#8217;t know the difference between pencil grades and I didn&#8217;t think I even wanted to learn much about pencil shading, which I&#8217;m still working on (a lot) so I just grabbed a range (6B, 2B, B, HB, F, H, 2H, 6H). They didn&#8217;t have anything beyond 6 in either direction so I figured I was getting the spread.</p>\n<p>But I figured I should fill the gaps so I got the missing ones&#8211;or so I thought. After I left (and the store closed), I realized that when I reached into the 4H box, I grabbed an HB. So I&#8217;m still missing a 4H and I&#8217;d like to get an 8B or 9B (or maybe just some charcoal)&#8230; anyway:<br />\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/atomantic/4955320311/\" title=\"Pencils by antic, on Flickr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/img-170.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Pencils\" /></a><br />\n(yay pencils)</p>\n",

It&#8217;s all you can do, that or sell parts. It&#8217;s better to gain a little implant than lose a little kidney or push your plasma on the street. At least these guys are professional. Or so they seem. How could you tell if this was legit or something sinister? It&#8217;s so easy to make things. The suits, the badges, the equipment. It looks like it would have been expensive before you could just make things. But now, these guys could be broke, selling off your data to the personality cloners, pushing our your identity to the over-net, leaking out your dreams to the pay-per-view audiences in distant places.</p>\n<p>You wonder for a minute if this is your fifteen minutes of fame. Could it be? Could this be all there is to show? You&#8217;ve got this tube of gelatinous metal in your ribcage. Are you the first to try it? Probably. You try bending and find it&#8217;s sore. You jump, push, pull, drop and roll. There in a half turnpipe spin, you find bliss. This new ribcage of yours just splits open to reveal a tentacle mesh of neotechnic hands, reaching out for perch against the walls, rocketing you back and forth. You close your eyes. They carry you, these arms, walking for you, bounding through the hallway of the artificial medical unit. There at the end, you see a woman in white standing next to a hover-tray. It&#8217;s giving her in injection. She faints. Move along. Nothing to see here. Nothing but images as you float by, out into the streets.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a place in the park where all the old men go to die. They play games with their past selves, screaming banter at bankers, bidding on winners and pranksters. Eventually, it all caves in. The pieces fall. The trees sag and drop their leaves.</p>\n",

But in Germany, when I see an old person on the tram&#8211;or meet in a friend&#8217;s house, I&#8217;m totally at a loss. They lived through Nazi Germany, and, most likely in Magdeburg and in other parts of eastern Germany, probably lived in the DDR.</p>\n<p>Fred and Rita, Sebastian&#8217;s parents, took us near the east/west Germany border, a short drive (just over the hill) from their house in Schnellmannshausen. They pointed out the area that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi\">Stasi</a> patrolled and explained the areas where you could, at the time of the DDR, encounter land mines and auto-firing border protection weaponry. Prisoners in their own land. They showed us the papers that allowed them to travel in and out of their town (within the rest of East Germany), which was specially guarded and identification enforced because of it&#8217;s location. Rita even had a receipt for an automobile request she made, which had a 20 year waiting list in the DDR. They explained all about the corruption and problems with the socialist experiment and how it broke down. Fred was even offered to become part of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi\">Stasi</a>, which he obviously declined.</p>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-2 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */\n\t\t</style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-2' class='gallery galleryid-314 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3722/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-51.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3723/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-52.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3724/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-53.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><br style=\"clear: both\" /><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3732/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-54.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3748/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-55.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3749/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-56.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><br style=\"clear: both\" /><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3750/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-57.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3752/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-58.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3753/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-59.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><br style=\"clear: both\" /><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3720/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-60.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3721/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-61.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon portrait'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/eisenach-and-wartburg-castle/img_3761/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-62.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl><br style=\"clear: both\" />\n\t\t</div>\n\n",

Until last night, when we made rolls and had them with various spreads (including peanut butter), he had never in his life tried peanut butter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not common here.&#8221; He said.</p>\n<p>Looking at the bottle, as our housemates pointed out, sure enough, it was &#8220;American Peanut Butter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wild.</p>\n<h3>Garbage and Recycling Separation is on a Whole New Order of Specificity</h3>\n<p>Everywhere you go (even on the train) there are at least 4 different bins to put your garbage, organic compost, recycling and recycling of many various types. It&#8217;s nice to see that they care so much, but I haven&#8217;t gotten used to it yet in our kitchen.</p>\n<p>We have a place for compost, another for newspaper and other papers, another for glass bottles, another for wet garbage that cannot be composted, another for dry garbage that cannot be recycled or composted, and if we wanted to comply fully, we could start more buckets for things like corks that you might get from a wine bottle (which have to be taken to a special place).</p>\n<h3>It&#8217;s Helpful to Always have a Euro&#8230; and Bags</h3>\n<p>The grocery store has a neat system for shopping carts. You have to unlock it by depositing a 1 Euro coin into the key slot. When you return your cart, you get your Euro back. Now I keep a special Euro with my keys in my pocket :)</p>\n<p>The grocery store also charges for bags. Everyone brings reusable bags with them shopping. What we tried to pass as a law in Seattle is just common practice here.</p>\n<h3>Apartments Don&#8217;t Come with Anything</h3>\n<p>We viewed an apartment today and noticed it has no ceiling light in the bedroom. It has the wires for it, and a light switch but no fixture. Apparently, it is up to the renter to supply these things. In fact, the apartment we were viewing was particularly unusual for an available rental in Germany because it had cabinets, a refrigerator, an oven, a kitchen sink, etc. Normally, apartments come with no appliances at all. When you move, you take everything, including the kitchen sink.</p>\n<h3>Electric Bills are Guesstimated then Fixed</h3>\n<p>When you rent an apartment, you pay for your rent plus a utilities rate based on your square meters. When your lease is finished (not every month), they calculate your real usage and either pay you back the overage or send you a bill for the unpaid amount used. I&#8217;m sure you can see issues that could arise from this.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are many other differences that I either haven&#8217;t noticed yet or have already become accustomed to. I&#8217;ll keep you updated with what I encounter.</p>\n",

    "content": "<h2>A Brief Digression About the Plane Ride and Sleep</h2>\n<p>The plane ride to Frankfurt was, as we expected, one of the more grueling experiences of our lives. I fondly remember getting on a plane and falling asleep, easily switching to whatever time zone I was about to join. I can sleep anywhere, anytime, but only if my little girl isn&#8217;t acting like a spider monkey, running around a plane, trying to make friends with everyone and entering tantrum phase when she gets too tired to cope with being stuck on a plane.</p>\n<p>We have a fabulous system with our daughter that usually lets her feel in control while still allowing us to prevent her from doing what we don&#8217;t want. The system is simple, which is why it usually works. When Ilya wants to do something that she can&#8217;t do for some reason&#8211;for example, run around the plane during inopportune times&#8211;we tell her, &#8220;you have a choice: daddy can hold you or you can lay in the bassinet (Lufthansa provided a mounted bed for her in front of one of the front row seats, which was awesome).&#8221; This worked about the first dozen times. Just as at home, she would weigh the options, decide which was better and cuddle up to daddy. Eventually, though, she realized that she could make up a 3rd option, bending over backward over backward and moaning or squirming out of grasp and running as fast as she could down the aisle to meet up with her new friend Sophie (an 8 month old girl).</p>\n<p>This flight was 10 hours. It went from 2pm Seattle time to 12am Seattle time. Ilya *should* have slept a 2-3 hour nap in the first part of the flight, plus a good 4 hours at the end of the flight. Or at least, that&#8217;s the schedule she kept at home. Not this time.</p>\n<p>She slept in the bassinet for about 20 minutes while I watched Harry Potter in German. Then she woke up&#8230; and stayed awake until 5 minutes before the plane landed in Frankfurt.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, her sleep schedule got flipped. Now she&#8217;s napping instead of sleeping a full night and sleeping through the day instead. Ach!</p>\n<p>But anyway, I&#8217;m rambling instead of getting to the story that relates to the title of this post:</p>\n<h2>The Luggage Incident&#8230;</h2>\n<p>So, there we are, at the end of our plane ride. The pass through immigration was a snap. Stamp, stamp, stamp. Willkommen in Deutschland!</p>\n<p>We trekked down to the baggage claim, which was a bit of a walk from where we got off, but easy enough to find.</p>\n<p>Here we found our luggage:<br />\n<a href=\"http://dailybooth.com/antic/2695209\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/img-109.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"87bc98a0c2c5cc86e2b52e2b9d8ebe9f_2695209\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-277\" srcset=\"https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/87bc98a0c2c5cc86e2b52e2b9d8ebe9f_2695209-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/87bc98a0c2c5cc86e2b52e2b9d8ebe9f_2695209.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a></p>\n<p>And then we decided to resume our original plan to take only 1 suitcase. So, we took those two smaller bags and crammed their contents back into the giant green suitcase. After a bit of stomping, we got it to zip closed again.</p>\n<p>We then found some very helpful people who directed us to the U-Bahn (train), which is conveniently located immediately under the airport. Each ticket from the airport to Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof (the central train station) was â‚¬3,50. Seems reasonable. The train got us to the station in about 10 minutes. We guesstimated our arrival since we couldn&#8217;t make out a single syllable of the announcer, who garbled the stop names through what sounded like a tin can saved over from the war.</p>\n<p>As soon as we stepped off the train and sorted who was carrying what luggage, I set Ilya&#8217;s backpack on top of the giant green suitcase, noticed something odd, looked up at the ceiling and smacked my head in a grand cartoon gesture. Then I looked at my wife who was dumbfounded.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We left the pack&#8217;n&#8217;play at the airport, in the luggage carousel&#8221;</p>\n<p>Deep breath. The Pack&#8217;n&#8217;Play is Ilya&#8217;s mobile bed. We NEED the Pack&#8217;n&#8217;Play. It wasn&#8217;t something we could leave behind.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just go to the hotel, I&#8217;ll put Ilya down to sleep and you can take the train back and get it.&#8221; Lena chimed in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah&#8230; ok.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So we went to search for our hotel. Let me pause here to recommend our hotel. We are staying at <a href=\"http://www.hotelexcelsior-frankfurt.de/\">Hotel Excelsior</a>, which was the single easiest hotel to get to in Frankfurt am Main. We stepped out of the south entrance at the train station and there it was, literally, right across the street. Along with the usual free wi-fi, continental breakfast (very tasty breakfast with smoked salmon, veritable brÃ¶tchen, etc), the hotel room comes with a free minibar. It&#8217;s nothing miraculous. The contents consist of 2 sparkling mineral waters, 1 non-bubbly mineral water, 2 beers, 2 orange juice bottles and 2 bottles of coke. This is such a brilliant little addition. Considering the cost of this service (they maybe spend â‚¬6-8 to fill it), it&#8217;s a great investment in our happiness. The rooms are decent for the price&#8211;and the location is unbeatable. Our room, a double was â‚¬133 for 2 nights. Not cheap but nowhere near expensive.</p>\n<p>Once in the hotel (which had a very tricky key system), I set off for the Airport to fetch the missing luggage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dailybooth.com/antic/2695210\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"images/img-112.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"9306e6ac88289a15af5682db14943b80_2695210\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-278\" srcset=\"https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/9306e6ac88289a15af5682db14943b80_2695210-225x300.jpg 225w, https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/9306e6ac88289a15af5682db14943b80_2695210.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Across the street, in the Hauptbahnhof, I awaited upstairs this time (we had entered on a lower level on a slightly ugly red train). The train arrived and I stepped in. Immediately, I nearly stepped back off, aghast at how freaking beautiful the inside of the train was. I don&#8217;t want to take up the space rambling about all the little touches. It was just luxurious. And it was the same ticket price as the cheap looking train that we took from the airport. Well, well. I sat back and watched the scenery go by.</p>\n<p>This time, I knew exactly where to get off the train. The announcer spoke in both German and English, clearly and pleasantly.</p>\n<p>Now came the fun part. How do I get back into the baggage claim area? I walked up to the first helpful looking person I could find and started in, &#8220;Entschuldigen Sie bitte&#8230; Ich habe mein GepÃ¤ck vergessen&#8230;ah&#8230; Sprechen Sie Englisch?&#8221; I chickened out. With the stress and chaos of the trip, I couldn&#8217;t muster up the German to explain everything and it occurred to me that everyone&#8217;s English here is better than my German. Indeed, everyone did speak english, but after this person sent me to one end of the airport (very helpfully, I might add), I tried again, &#8220;Entschuldigen Sie bitte, Ich habe mein GepÃ¤ck vergessen.&#8221; We had a brief conversation in German, in which, I learned where to go next. Again, I met someone and had a similar conversation. I found someone who directed me to someone else, who directed me to another place, which ended up requiring me to talk to another person and so on. Everyone was extremely helpful and polite. Everyone <em>except</em> the guy who actually worked at the Information Booth! I asked people who had absolutely no reason to even talk to me and who gave me fabulous directions and advice. But this guy at the information booth actually gave me misinformation&#8211;and with a bit of an attitude. So strange. He acted like there was no way I could get my luggage back. After much back and forth, I ended up with this from him:</p>\n<p>>>We can&#8217;t just let anyone in there. You have to talk to Lufthansa.<< \n\nI walked away, found someone who worked for Lufthansa, who politely directly me to walk around and down, straight into the baggage claim area.\n\nBut, short story long, I ran all around the airport several times, trying to get into the correct baggage claim area. I even spent a good 15 minutes circling the wrong baggage claim area trying to figure out how to get to the right carousel. However, I eventually found the storage room, showed my passport, matched my name to the foldable baby bed and proudly walked back down to the train station.\n\nApparently, by this time, I had gained some outward appearance of self-confidence, having now conversed with a dozen or so Germans in their native tongue, as another foreigner (me thinks Polish or Czech) came up to me and asked (in German) if the next train was going to the Frankfurt am Main Hauptbahnhof. After stuttering a bit, totally taken aback that he would choose me to answer his query, I was actually able to explain to him that yes, it is, here is where it says so on the timetable and I will be boarding that train as well. Delighted, he went back to his companion and we boarded separate cars.\n\nMost of the trip back, I imagined a conversation we could have had, had I moved down the way and joined them in their car. I realized that I could explain my whole ordeal, with fairly decent gestures and imagery all in German, which would have been wonderful practice. So, rather than regretting, I practiced in my head. The train was once again one of the old looking ones, run down and manned by a garbled fishmonger--but it was a pleasant ride, nonetheless. \n\nWith one foot standing on my little girl's folded bed, holding down my captured bounty, I sat proud, staring off into the German landscape, muttering to myself like a loon.\n\n</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>So we moved to Germany. This all started when our friends, <a href=\"http://andjuggling.com\">Brendan and Stina</a> decided to settle down in Magdeburg after traveling around as buskers. Actually, it started a few years ago when Lena and I made a pact that we would someday live abroad for a year. We had tentatively toyed with the idea of Singapore or Taiwan but hadn&#8217;t writ anything in stone. Then along came news from our friends that rent is cheap in Magdeburg, life is good and the EU is a travel mecca (as if we didn&#8217;t already know the last part). So we thought about it for a minute (in itemized format):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I work as a telecommuting web developer (so I can work from anywhere in the world that has a decent net connection)</li>\n<li>My wife isn&#8217;t tied down with a job (aside from taking care of our daughter, which, although is certainly a form of being tied down, it&#8217;s a mobile form)</li>\n<li>Our daughter, Ilya, is only 1.5 years old (or was when we made the decision) so she isn&#8217;t in pre-school yet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, all the stars being in alignment, we purchased plane tickets.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, we flew 10 hours (non-stop) from Seattle to Frankfurt. We found much amusement during our fretting about selling off our belongings and renting out our house when our friends and family would constantly remind us that &#8220;once you get on the plane you can just relax.&#8221; Of course, none of these people are experienced in the art of flying 10 hours with a toddler. It was, as we expected, more exhausting than the whole lead up to moving.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself.</p>\n<p>We spent the last several months selling off nearly everything we own. Every week, I would look around the house and gasp, &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe we still have so much stuff!&#8221;<br />\nEven on the last day, as we packed up a stack of things to store at Lena&#8217;s mother&#8217;s house, I couldn&#8217;t believe how much we still had. I remember moving up to Seattle 10 years ago with two boxes and a mattress. Now, with a family and two houses, I&#8217;ve acquired enough stuff to crush the life out of me 10 times over.</p>\n<p>But we paired down, sold things, drove to Good Will about 25 times, stored a few things at parent&#8217;s houses and eventually got it down to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 Pack &#8216;n&#8217; Play (Ilya&#8217;s portable bed)</li>\n<li>1 Stroller</li>\n<li>2 large suitcases (very large)</li>\n<li>3 backpacks (one for each of us)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fifteen minutes before driving to Seatac airport, I looked at my wife, she looked at me and we both agreed. We have too much stuff. Maybe we can get rid of one of these large suitcases!</p>\n<p>We were ruthless. Nothing was spared critical scrutiny. And we did it. One large suitcase, jammed pack.</p>\n<p>Now, this seemed great. We had less baggage, less stuff and more mobility. At least, it seemed that way&#8230; until we got to the airport.</p>\n<p>As we loaded up the large suitcase on the Lufthansa check-in weigh station, the attendant looked at us with concerned eyes, &#8220;Is there any way you can get this down below 32KG?&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was 38 Kilos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Uh, maybe&#8230;&#8221; (that&#8217;s like 13 lbs. to shave off).</p>\n<p>He gestured to the other end of the airport. &#8220;You could buy another piece of luggage. It&#8217;s a $160 charge if you can&#8217;t get it down to size.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So, I ran. I ran to the whole other end of Seatac to a Hudson News, which sold these little travel bags. I bought one and ran back.</p>\n<p>We ripped apart the suitcase, finding all the heaviest items that would fit. Score. I think we got it. Now the large suitcase was 28KG!</p>\n<p>Back at the check-in desk, a new attendant gave us another sad look. &#8220;Any way you can you get it down below 23KG?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;What? I thought it was 32&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Between 23-32KG there is a $160 charge for oversize. You have to get it below 23KG per bag.&#8221;</p>\n<p>NOOOOOOO!</p>\n<p>ok.</p>\n<p>I ran back and bought another little bag. Again we ripped apart the suitcase, moving all the heaviest items over to the small bag. And, once again, we got it down.</p>\n<p>22.8! w00t. Now our awesome ideal of traveling with 1 large suitcase instead of 2 has become traveling with 1 large suitcase + 2 small travel bags. Sigh.</p>\n<p>Now to board the plane&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Tune in later&#8230;</h2>\n<p>&#8230;for the next installment: &#8220;Ich habe mein GepÃ¤ck vergessen!

They curse and rant in hi-def subliminal microwave, neon vector raves pulsing from the decks of their cars, flashes of red and black, blipping abuse at the other motorcraves. One in particular, this jocky puck who sports a flyboy mohawk and a thread leather seatback throttles it forward next to Benny, giving him the bird with his telehand. Benny is thrown for a sec by the florescent intrusion. The projection threatens the sky with epileptic seizures. Cars screech and skitter around the blaze of light.</p>\n<p>Benny sucks it up; he&#8217;s taken the piss before from ingrate halflings who haven&#8217;t been on the track longer than the day. This punkbag doesn&#8217;t have the verbal skills to make Benny flinch. And with that, a kiss-off glance and a for-real finger in the air, Benny rips the box a new one. There&#8217;s something to be said for the finesse of a seasoned motorcrave, but you have to be there to witness it for yourself.</p>\n<p>The causeway is clear now; the light is gone.

This is the dream of a new reality. Sometimes I think I see someone sweet; itâ€™s never a known quantity. This feeling will pass. Who needs it anyway. A feeling of broken ambition and itâ€™s all it takes to go down.</p>\n<p>Back in the bar she sits sipping sapphire gin, looking up from the glass only to flirt with the bartender. Heâ€™s too old for her, or so thinks the boy on the other side of the counter. Heâ€™s been a bar-back for 3 days but thatâ€™s long enough to know the type that sits alone, drinking like a fish and pining for the older gents. She could do better, he thinks. She could do him.</p>\n<p>Thereâ€™s this place back east. Itâ€™s a festival that goes on all year. Sometimes I dream about it, full of people running around all the time, splashing each other with their drinks, joyously, celebrating whatever it is they wish, without fears or regrets. I donâ€™t remember the name, hope itâ€™s the same.</p>\n<p>Wet washed and wiped out, drowning in peptides. I can feel this fuzzy fissure in my scalp, running down my neck. Itâ€™s like itâ€™s been engineered to tickle my melancholy. I canâ€™t remember the last time I had this emotion. Itâ€™s like swimming in the ocean at 10, or maybe I was 8. I stayed up late, ran out to the edge, found a fish that was swimming on sand, gasping for breath. I could tell it was in a bad place. Thereâ€™s no disgrace in gasping for breath when there isnâ€™t anything to breath. At least heâ€™s trying. At least his heart is in it. Pull through little tyke. Suck it up, thereâ€™s water right there. Just a nudge, a flick, a wet kiss.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m feeling more alone than ever now.</p>\n",

They were things every web developer should keep in mind after being hacked or in preparing for that scenario.</p>\n<p>However, the list didn&#8217;t provide any solid useful examples of why the items are important. They also missed some really important issues that affect all web developers.</p>\n<p>Here are a few security concerns I keep with me whenever I develop a site:</p>\n<p>1. Always filter for malicious data and THEN validate user input, both on the server side. Do not rely on JavaScript or any other client-side technology to prevent hacking attempts or malformed data. Look up XSS (cross-site scripting):<br />\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting</a></p>\n<p>2. Build your server side scripts so that they cannot fall victim to cross-site request forgery<br />\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery</a></p>\n<p>3. For any user login form/handler, use SSL Get a cert (something like $100)&#8211;or generate and sign one yourself (free), which requires you and your users to add a security exception (because it&#8217;s self signed):<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.yatblog.com/2007/02/27/how-to-create-a-ssl-certificate/\">http://www.yatblog.com/2007/02/27/how-to-create-a-ssl-certificate/</a><br />\nIf you fail to make this information go via SSL on your webserver, you are requiring all of your users to send passwords in cleartext through every computer between them and your webserver.</p>\n<p>4. Always use SSH/SFTP to connect to your webserver. FTP is insecure. When you connect via FTP, you are sending your credentials in cleartext over the network. Anyone listening in will be able to scrape your access info.</p>\n<p>5. Escape any database input before it goes into queries, lest you become victim of SQL injections:<br />\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection</a></p>\n<p>There are many more concerns but these are the ones that jump to my mind this early in the morning.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s a list of the top 10 things you would like to accomplish in your life before you &#8220;kick the bucket&#8221;.</p>\n<p>01. Become financially independent (meaning I don&#8217;t have to work at all if I don&#8217;t want to because I have enough passive income to just play music, travel the world, write and spend time with my family and friends) before I turn 31. Last year, my goal was before I turn 30, but I think I&#8217;m going to be 6 months late of that mark.</p>\n<p>02. Do a free standing back-flip. I wish I had done this a few years ago when I got health insurance for the first time in 8 years. Now I&#8217;m without coverage again and I just don&#8217;t want to risk it. I fell on my head without insurance a few years ago and they charged me $4K to tell me I was OK. I guess I&#8217;ll have to wait for completion of #01.</p>\n<p>03. Write a novel. I haven&#8217;t even gotten to the first draft phase but I do have 6 Word documents with crappy titles, meager plot summaries, a few brainstorm snippets and two character outlines. I&#8217;m half way there, right? o_0</p>\n<p>04. Speak at a TED conference. <a href=\"http://www.TED.com\">http://www.TED.com</a>. On what? Whatever it is that I give to the world before #10 happens.</p>\n<p>05. Master the Accordion. I&#8217;ve had an accordion for 8 years. I love it. It&#8217;s awesome. Every time I pick it up and play it, I get hypnotized by how awesome it sounds. If I were stuck on a desert island and I could take only one thing with me, I would still choose to take a boat but if loopholes like that weren&#8217;t allowed and I was forced to choose something that couldn&#8217;t get me off the island, I would probably take an accordion.</p>\n<p>06. Produce a musical album. I love to sing but I know I&#8217;m not that good at it. After mastering the accordion, I&#8217;ll probably move onto that part, but I love music of all kinds, so I might pick up another instrument.</p>\n<p>07. Travel the world with my daughter. My little girl is teh awesome!!!!11!!!one! I want to show her all the places I haven&#8217;t seen yet.</p>\n<p>08. Learn to speak, read and write Mandarin Chinese fluently. And German, Russian, Arabic, Zulu, Hindi&#8230; I would also like to learn just enough of every language that I could pick out a strangers dialect and say a few simple phrases with confidence. Just a &#8220;Hey, you speak {language name}? Cool. I&#8217;m just learning.&#8221; It&#8217;s surprising what kind of connections come out of just knowing that.</p>\n<p>09. Create a game or some other meme that will withstand the test of time, passing from generation to generation.</p>\n<p>10. Become a singularity. Hey, screw this whole &#8216;before death&#8217; thing. I plan to bypass that part.</p>\n<p>Previous buckets kicked:</p>\n<p>* Master riding the unicycle<br />\n* Learn a foreign language&#8230;not necessarily fluently ;)<br />\n* Buy a house<br />\n* Visit any part of Europe (went to London)<br />\n* Visit any part of Asia (went to Thailand)<br />\n* Have a child<br />\n* Start a business</p>\n",

In one of the classrooms, textbooks are flying through the air, having grown large teeth, attempting to bite the children.<br />\n&#8220;This isn&#8217;t just a zombie infection! This is some sort of magic.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;That&#8217;s great news!&#8221; Says one of my cohorts, &#8220;It&#8217;s not a disease! We just need to find a magician.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the men traveling with us knows where to find a magician and he takes us to his house. Surprisingly, this magician doesn&#8217;t know anything about the zombie attack. He believes us anyway and takes us into the ocean. &#8220;There,&#8221; he says, &#8220;we will meet another magician who can help you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the depths of the sea, we find many new life-forms that we have never heard of before.</p>\n<p>A cube shaped fish with bioluminescent saturn-like rings around it swims by. It&#8217;s gathering energy kenetically from other fish and creatures swimming in the water. It floats into a school of fish who twirl around the cube frantically. The cube gets brighter. A shark comes, pushing energy into the water as it feasts upon the swirl of fish. The cube and it&#8217;s rings get brighter and more energetic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like an alien.&#8221; I say.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How do you know it&#8217;s not?&#8221; The magician replies.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />\nOK, this dream really does go on forever so I&#8217;m going to leave it at that. To remind myself of the rest:</p>\n<p>* Cubic alien beast becomes a flying carpet under the sea.<br />\n* Old lady magician under the sea, threatens attack but recognizes the traveling magician as a former lover.<br />\n* Infiltrating the military and fighting the attack.<br />\n* Vines growing out of the ground to consume the army.<br />\n* An unused field with chained up trees, under attack of consumption. To rebuild or let die?<br />\n* Pretending to be a woman and using the restroom at a closed down supermarket.<br />\n* The creepy janitors<br />\n* The Costco is closed<br />\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s sum it up with a Common Craft Zombie Guide:</p>\n<p><object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" height=\"260\" width=\"320\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/bVnfyradCPY&amp;rel=0\" id=\"VideoPlayback\" ><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/bVnfyradCPY&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAcess\" value=\"sameDomain\"/><param name=\"quality\" value=\"best\"/><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"/><param name=\"scale\" value=\"noScale\"/><param name=\"salign\" value=\"TL\"/><param name=\"FlashVars\" value=\"playerMode=embedded\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /></object></p>\n",

I befriend him. We discuss the changing scene of classical composition in modern times. He invites me over to his yacht where we drink and laugh about the past.</p>\n<p>My family is with me now.

There is a giant circle full of nearly ready drops of water, waiting to splash down.<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s from the rain.&#8221; Someone says.<br />\n&#8220;But it&#8217;s not raining&#8230;&#8221; I reply.<br />\nDownstairs, I&#8217;m in the kitchen, trying to get a drink of water and I notice that the middle of the kitchen floor is full of moss and clovers growing out of the ground. I seem to like it and decide not to try to remove any of it. At the sink, there are insects flying all around and I see one that looks like a swan. It&#8217;s about the size of a dragonfly but it&#8217;s softly feathered and has a long curved neck. It warps a little and now appears to be a small flying woman with no arms. But then I see she is only holding her arms up and over her head. I smile and move out of the kitchen, into the living room and stare at the ceiling, where down here too there is a big circle, dripping water and filth onto the floor. The water seems to be pooling up and soaking into the floor, then trickling down floor by floor.</p>\n<p>Outside, I head to the bookshop, where many people are speaking about historical texts and how they relate to religion in modern times. </p>\n<p>There is a boy who is studying Abraxas but he starts to follow a path that is being generated in front of him. A large stepping stone appears inches from his feet and as soon as he steps onto it, another appears in front of that one. He keeps this going until he is almost all the way around the world, traversing oceans and mountains with the steps rising and lowering to fit the terrain. When he is almost around the world the steps begin to go upward at an alarming pace, the boy just barely able to climb up to each next step. Before long, he is walking outside of the atmosphere, no problem breathing, circling the earth.</p>\n<p>Narrowly avoiding the boy, a space Winnebago cruses into orbit and slams into the atmosphere, prepared to land in the city where I am watching this. The robot gets out of the machine and now it&#8217;s me. I am the robot. I am from space, looking for a new ride. Mine is old and won&#8217;t get me back into space.</p>\n<p>On the next block, I see a real, honest space missile full of tourists, prepared to take off. It also looks like a Winnebago but when I sneak inside and the thrusters start up, i realize it isn&#8217;t as spacious as mine. There is only one seat I can fit into and it&#8217;s crammed up against a steering wheel. Nevertheless, I shoot up into space.</p>\n<p>The missile doesn&#8217;t make it all the way and we land in the ocean near Russia. Swimming through dark waters, we find ourselves near ocean oil storage. There are vast pools of crude oil just floating in the waters, held together only by the chemicals own attraction to itself. When fish swim through it, the disturb it&#8217;s purity and get coated in the black sludge. A tanker is on its way to siphon some of the oil. It doesn&#8217;t matter how pure it is. It will get whatever it can and sell it at a discount.</p>\n<p>We board the barge and when we get to land, everyone is fighting. It&#8217;s night and all I can see is fire and red hot pellets whizzing by our heads, shot from the pistols of the enemy. We have archaic weapons but they fire quickly. I&#8217;m reaching a tube into my pocket to fill it with tiny pellets, to reload my gun. It fires rapidly, randomly, into the wall of men. Like a fully automatic minuteman, I&#8217;m taking them down in seconds. We continue to march, just walking straight into the line of fire, gunning for the front line.</p>\n<p>When the smoke clears and the bodies fall, we find ourselves in a theme park. The boy following the trail of stones is here. I tell my group we should go see an attraction that I remembered from a dream I had a few months ago. Behind one of the members of my group, I see floating islands with fortresses on them and a pair of noblemen battling each other on one of the island edges.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There it is!&#8221; I point.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>The air is humid. I run and the wind screams passed my ears like a whistle full of steam. There is no direction but forward, like Iâ€™m shot from the belly of a plane, face-first and fearless. There is no turning back, no resistance to the inevitable. My legs begin to feel fluid, elastic. I fold into my torso, triggering the wheels in my kneecaps, elbows and wrists. Bending lower my kneewheels hit first, followed by my banded and wheeled hands. The elbows catch the ground simply as a navigational aid, bouncing on and off as needed. The ground flow is slightly uneven and the momentum of my fall leaves me with the need to continue rolling over onto my back. With a simple twist of my shoulders, I tilt and the sensors in my body armor eject wheels out from my shoulder blades, moving my kneewheels down to the heels and projecting a ferrofluid bearing helmet over my scalp. I always feel like closing my eyes for a second or two when I enter this position at such velocity. Itâ€™s a long time pleasure that I grant myself every chance I get. Just feeling the motion of the road under my body, I almost drift asleep. But the momentum continues. As the road approaches a right hand turn, I rotate and shoot my left hand out at the ground, gripping tight, pushing off, my legs go over head and for an instant Iâ€™m gliding with so much speed, upside down, watching the pedestrians in there civil suits, scornfully bemoaning my invasion in their walk space.<br />\nâ€œWatch it there Insect!â€ One shouts.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>After reading this <a href=\"http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/the-male-and-fe.html\">Marginal Revolution post</a> on the male and female privilege checklist, I noticed a few things the following lists were missing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amptoons.com/blog/the-male-privilege-checklist/\">Amptoons Male List</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2008/06/08/female-privilege/\">Feminist Critics Female List</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wihe.com/displayNews.jsp?id=400\">Women in Higher Education Female List</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, let me say, I oppose assigning values to this items and comparing whether it&#8217;s better to be one sex over the other. Once someone tallied up and said &#8220;ok, the score leans to side X&#8221;, it&#8217;s going to start an endless battle of finding another thing that one sex has over the other. And really, what makes what list and what gets which value, is preposterously arbitrary.<br />\nAlso, I consider myself a feminist. My additions are not intended to skew to one side or the other. Comment if you like with your additions. Mostly this is just a humorous but honest observation on some inequality in modern day USA culture and in nature. These lists do not include racial or sexual preference advantages.<br />\nI avoided mentioning things that are obviously benefits and hinderances at the same time (e.g. men are expected to be better drivers than women&#8211;this is sometimes to the benefit of the male and sometimes to the benefit of a female).</p>\n<p>anyway, here are my additions:</p>\n<h3>Male:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I can pee standing up, which allows me to pee just about anywhere without pulling my pants down (e.g. in a bottle on a road trip)</li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t have to deal with monthly bleeding</li>\n<li>If I rise high in my career, I can be comfortable that people will not think I got there through supplying sexual favors to my superiors</li>\n<li>I can run without worrying about long term damage to pectoral perkiness</li>\n<li>Video games are more likely to be tailored to my interests and playing style</li>\n<li>I can compete in sports without people questioning my sexual preference</li>\n<li>I can have a child without damaging my body in labor</li>\n<li>I don&#8217;t have to get routine pap-smears</li>\n<li>As I get older, my attractiveness increases (to a point) to younger members of the opposite sex.</li>\n<li>I am not pressured to feel guilty about what I eat (until I get old)</li>\n<li>In a crisis situation, someone from my gender is likely to be given (or to take) command</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Female:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Public restrooms for my gender are likely to be cleaner, some having couches and other luxuries</li>\n<li>If I am caring for a baby in public, my restroom is more likely to have a changing table</li>\n<li>I can receive student financial aid without having to &#8216;volunteer&#8217; for Selective Services (the Draft)</li>\n<li>If I am moderately attractive, I can advance my career (or begin one) by emphasizing this quality</li>\n<li>When on a date or with a friend of the opposite sex, it is likely that I will not be expected to pay for anything&#8211;regardless of my income level</li>\n<li>I can display the uninhibited enthusiasm of a child without people questioning my intelligence or sexuality</li>\n<li>I am not expected to be athletic, lest my value as a member of my sex be questioned</li>\n<li>when sitting on any splayed-legged object (horse, bike, unicycle, etc&#8230;), I don&#8217;t have to worry about getting &#8216;racked&#8217;</li>\n<li>I am not expected to have to deal with spiders, snakes, worms or anything else that may be dangerous or gross (with the exception of snot, vomit, and poop in regard to my own children)</li>\n<li>Bars and clubs frequently have a weekly night where I get in free. If not, I can probably get someone from the opposite sex to pay for my entrance anyway (and likely some drinks as well).</li>\n<li>I can dance anywhere with a low probability that people will question my sexuality or sanity</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "content": "<p>I&#8217;m up in a skyscraper that scrapes the ionosphere. It&#8217;s mostly under construction on the bottom of the tower but it&#8217;s all finished and full of people up top. There are escalators everywhere and I&#8217;m running down them. My Heely skate shoes come in handy as I round the corner and glide down one of the special wheelchair ramp escalators. It&#8217;s totally flat but it moves me faster than I can run. When I hit the bottom of the ramp I grab hold of a metal bar encircling the next escalator and I jump up through the opening that separates the pedestrian walkway from the pedestrian freeway. Now I&#8217;m flying. My feet tap every fiftieth step on the electric stairway, just enough to keep my momentum but the angle of descent is enough for me to nearly free-fall down dozens of floors.<br />\nAlthough I&#8217;m going fast, I know they are not far behind me, Yakuza, gokudÅ, but not bÅryokudan&#8211;this group isn&#8217;t violent by nature. I think they just want to question me, why, I don&#8217;t know but I&#8217;m running anyway. It&#8217;s not that I mind answering questions, I just like to answer questions with all my fingers intact at the end of the conversation.<br />\nIn almost no time at all, I&#8217;m nearing the underdeveloped part of the tower. The are no longer any escalators and I must take one of the large elevators they use to cart equipment. It also carries a lot of people on sometimes, like tonight, where countless tuxedo and gown clad citizens celebrate on the roof, gazing at the less distant stars, getting drunk off of the high altitude.<br />\nFor a second, I worry that they may have someone stationed in the lift. Luckily, they had flown in and landed on the roof. They must not have had anyone come from the ground, yet. The elevator takes me all the way down to the basement level, my ears popping all the way. In the lowest level of the building, there are even more people than on the roof. They are getting ready for a Cirque performance of some kind.<br />\nI grab a seat, trying to be inconspicuous. The show starts and immediately I am unimpressed. They have giraffe unicycle magicians catching fine pieces of cloth, which are being projected out of thin air, but I can see a black gloved hand throwing them from behind an even blacker drapery. The contortionists are weak and the jugglers falter.</p>\n",

These points are programmed with Nanos to link to each other over distances of up to 500 meters. After I draw the second of a set, it stretches out a thin line to the first box and creates a barrier. No other artist can paint this wall now. The arrows communicate with a strange, sub-microscopic sentience. I stand back, proud. This rooftop is huge. It has layers of paint, over which the years have layered more and more paint, more and more untamed art. But now it&#8217;s mine.<br />\nDownstairs is a hospital. I take a peak inside and everyone is bustling. The sun is rising and I must go to work. The office is in there today. We are meeting in the cafeteria.<br />\nMy boss, who seems to be alternating appearance of gender as frequently as David Bowie, is giving a slideshow demo. He sees me come in and begins pointing his questions toward me.<br />\n&#8220;Watch as I scroll down the code to the middle here. Everything looks fine until we get to this little blue cloud.&#8221;<br />\nThe page scrolls down and reveals an intensely colored cloud, thinly stretched from the left margin to the right. below it is an arrow, pointing in the same direction.<br />\n&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I say, &#8220;The problem is that the cloud is the end of the page in this instance.&#8221; Everyone turns to look at me. &#8220;We fill in the whole template, regardless of the situation, but we&#8217;ve got all this conditional logic to figure out if we should even show all the stuff we&#8217;ve already filled in. We really need a better templating system.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Ah, see that&#8217;s what we expect.&#8221; Bowie triumphantly declares.<br />\n&#8220;Ah, I see.&#8221; I agree.</p>\n<p>Down the corridor of the hospital, I see an old woman getting a scowling look from one of her peers. She walks away and soon another nurse drills down on her with visual malice. She ducks into a room with glass walls and a glass door. I can see her sitting there, head slumped. Outside, her co-workers gather. All of them grimacing and shaking their heads. They bare down their brows and scrunch up their jaws pointedly. Nobody is saying anything, just looking very angry. The woman in the room closes her eyes and leans back in her chair. She has had enough. She will not give them whatever satisfaction they seek. She folds up her arms around her torso, leans back, and dies.<br />\nIt&#8217;s only a matter of seconds before everyone realizes she will never come out alive again.</p>\n",

I pull myself up to look at her. &#8220;Is it time?&#8221;, I ask.<br />\n&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s been going on all night.&#8221; she replies, eyes clenched, hands on her torso.<br />\nI slump out of bed and meander to the shower. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve woken this early.<br />\nDownstairs, I make some eggs and a bagel with Toffuti cream cheese. It&#8217;s a filling breakfast that I will later be quite thankful for making. Lena only has a bagel.<br />\nNot long after we start timing the contractions, it&#8217;s obvious the time has come. We call our midwife and she agrees that we should meet at the birthing center at 7:30am.<br />\n&#8220;OK, let&#8217;s pack it all up.&#8221; Everything is already ready so their isn&#8217;t much to do but call people.<br />\nMy mother becomes 15 again when she hears it&#8217;s time and rushes out the door of her house in California to start a 12 hour drive to meet us. Lena&#8217;s step-mother is flying in and her biological mom lives in Seattle and plans to meet us at the birthing center.<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s a 30 minute drive so we should leave now.&#8221; I gather up all the stuff, everything we will need for 24-48 hours. I feed the cats extra. We drive.<br />\nAt the birthing center, things start slow. We put on some music and make Lena comfortable.<br />\nAfter about 5 hours, she&#8217;s gone from 4cm dilation to 4.5cm. I try to sooth the moment, &#8220;remember our classes? It starts slow, you&#8217;ll get up past 5 or 6 and then it&#8217;ll shoot up to 10 in only a couple of hours.&#8221;<br />\nLena is not entirely convinced but she agrees anyway.<br />\nThe labor continues. Lena&#8217;s step-mother arrives and soon my mother as well.<br />\nMany hours later, we get Lena up to 9cm, with only 1cm blocking the head from pushing its way into the birth canal&#8211;one little lip of a cervix, stubbornly holding the baby in.<br />\nAt 7am Monday, 28 hours after the onset of labor, we face a decision. Lena is exhausted. She&#8217;s been pushing harder and working more than anyone could believe. The last cm is unmovable. Lena can barely even stand anymore.<br />\nWe can try to continue and hope it works or we can go to Evergreen hospital down the road, get an epidural, some Pitocin and let Lena rest while the drugs do most of the work. Lena jumps on it (figuratively, she can&#8217;t jump worth beans at the moment). &#8220;Yes, I want the epidural. I can&#8217;t push anymore.&#8221;<br />\nAt the hospital, I&#8217;m wary (and weary). The doctors are kind but I still don&#8217;t trust them off the bat.<br />\nThe nurse asks us which shots we want to get and we tell her, &#8220;none&#8221;. We have it all arranged with our Pediatrician.<br />\n&#8220;Ok, do you want the Vitamin K?&#8221; she continues.<br />\n&#8220;No, we have that covered.&#8221; I sigh, &#8220;Basically, if you can just get the baby out and put it on mom&#8217;s chest, you guys are done.&#8221; The nurse laughs. She&#8217;s sympathetic to our plan.<br />\nThey start telling us what we already knew they would say, &#8220;The epidural is on the way. We&#8217;ll start the Pitocin and you&#8217;ll have a couple of hours but if we don&#8217;t see progress, we will need to get the baby out through Cesarean.&#8221; We agree to try. We want to do this as naturally as possible. I&#8217;m tired. I need a nap. I lay down and about an hour and a half later, I wake up to the doctor&#8217;s voice. He&#8217;s telling Lena she has to make some progress. I get up and get the details. We need to have contractions that are 2-4 seconds apart and go up to 60 on the seismic scale. I tell Lena to take deep breaths and not to fall asleep. The graphs dip when she rests and get bigger when she breathes deep. I get excited after an hour of this. We are getting there. Some of the contractions are making the mark, others are still lagging a bit.<br />\nI get a little hungry and head down to the cafe to get a hard-boiled egg. When I return, the doctor is in the room, explaining how the C-section will go. I guess this means we didn&#8217;t make it. I&#8217;m disappointed in what appears to be a lack of faith in the progress being made. Every time I see this doctor, I&#8217;m walking in or waking up to the conversation already happening.<br />\nWe consult our midwife (who has been with us the entire time) and she agrees, &#8220;we should have seen that last cm go away by now. With the Pitocin, they should have gotten some more progress.&#8221;<br />\nBefore I know it, I&#8217;m putting on scrubs and heading into the operating room. It&#8217;s brighter than I imagined, not like in the doctor shows where they have special lights shining down at certain spots. The whole room is lit from the ceiling.<br />\nThe anesthesiologist is very helpful, he directs me and Lena&#8217;s mother around the room to the place we can sit. I am right next to Lena, holding her arm and talking to her. Mel stands next to me, with a view of the operation. With Lena, I&#8217;m sitting behind the protective shield, with only a small window to peer out at the spot the baby will show up when they extract it. I tell them that I want to announce the gender because it&#8217;s a surprise. They are all excited. Surprises like this are uncommon these days.<br />\nThe operation is quick. and before I expect it, I hear a cry and look up through the opening.<br />\nIt takes me a second to realize that I was right. I had been starting to believe everyone else&#8217;s assurance that the baby is a boy&#8211;everyone to their own superstitions and old-tales. I stared for a second to make sure I didn&#8217;t announce the wrong gender, how embarrassing would that be?<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s Ilya! It&#8217;s a girl!&#8221;<br />\nLena tears up and they usher me over to the heat table where they wrap Ilya up with bracelets and clean her up. The weigh her and prick her heel to test her blood. She&#8217;s 9lbs 3oz, which requires the extra glucose test. She thrashes around and cries loudly. I can&#8217;t do anything and feel terribly helpless, like Ilya. I still have my scrubs on, mask and all when they finally let me hold her. I bring her to Lena and they begin to cart her out. &#8220;OK, you&#8217;ll need to follow us, the baby is tagged to the mom.&#8221;<br />\nAlarms will go off if the proximity is broken.<br />\nI walk out, mask and hat over my head and my mother is standing outside. She doesn&#8217;t recognize me or hear me say, &#8220;we have to follow them&#8221; but I don&#8217;t pay attention. I&#8217;m staring down at my baby girl, trying to keep an eye on the bed being wheeled around in front of me.</p>\n<p>We stayed at Evergreen for 2 nights, my mother and I taking nap shifts to watch the baby while Lena laid recovering from the operation. Evergreen was way better than we expected. They were continually apologetic for our situation, going against our birth plan, but all the while, they were more helpful than we could have hoped. Everything went perfectly. We have a perfect baby.</p>\n<p>OK, that&#8217;s not nearly detailed enough but it&#8217;s the general story. 34 hours of labor, ending in a C-section, we wanted to go natural with a water birth but ended up trying every birthing option available.</p>\n<p>Anyway, gotta go check up on on the wife and kid :)</p>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin: auto;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 .gallery-item {\n\t\t\t\tfloat: left;\n\t\t\t\tmargin-top: 10px;\n\t\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\t\t\t\twidth: 33%;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 img {\n\t\t\t\tborder: 2px solid #cfcfcf;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t#gallery-1 .gallery-caption {\n\t\t\t\tmargin-left: 0;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */\n\t\t</style>\n\t\t<div id='gallery-1' class='gallery galleryid-140 gallery-columns-3 gallery-size-thumbnail'><dl class='gallery-item'>\n\t\t\t<dt class='gallery-icon landscape'>\n\t\t\t\t<a href='https://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/ilya-eivy/adam-and-ilya-7/'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"images/img-123.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>\n\t\t\t</dt></dl>\n\t\t\t<br style='clear: both' />\n\t\t</div>\n\n",

There&#8217;s something strange in his voice and I don&#8217;t quite believe that he just got off a plane.<br />\nHe quizzes me with a few programming challenges but they are all elementary and I suspect he&#8217;s toying with me.<br />\n&#8220;Well, give me the answers to your questions in a week and I&#8217;ll start the evaluation. Then you can take part in whatever project you want or start making whatever project you can imagine.&#8221; He says.<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some great ideas for Google Calendar,&#8221; I exclaim. I&#8217;m an eager little puppy. &#8220;It should be able to log your life, like sleep and work hours and generate a report for you of what you spend your time doing.&#8221; I give him an eyebrow raise, hoping he&#8217;ll agree vehemently that I should start modifying the calendar code right now. Instead, he begins to cough.<br />\nAnd cough. And he stands, walking toward the door, coughing more violently.<br />\n&#8220;I need to call in an engineer!&#8221; He says, hurriedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for this.&#8221;<br />\nHe heads out the door and around the corner. I follow him and point him the way to the Men&#8217;s room. As he rounds the circuitous pathway of the building in search of respite, he continues his expulsion of airy fluids. Even through the walls and back in the conference room, I can hear him. It sounds viscous and hoarse, as if he&#8217;s on the verge of exploding his insides out onto the floor. I worry that I didn&#8217;t respond quickly enough to his needs. Perhaps he would hold that against me. Perhaps he would not be OK.<br />\nMinutes later, he returns with an engineer from Adobe Labs. The engineer is talking to him in a language I don&#8217;t understand and looks up at me with disapproving eyes.<br />\n&#8220;You can stay, but this is confidential.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Um, ok, sure&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m not really sure to what &#8216;this&#8217; is alluding.<br />\n&#8220;Ok, let&#8217;s take of the helm&#8230;&#8221; The engineer says, pulling at the Google man&#8217;s chest.<br />\nThe chest comes off, clean and with a few delicate clicks.<br />\n&#8220;A robot! AI? But then&#8230; He passed the Turing test! I didn&#8217;t have a clue!&#8221; I&#8217;m in shock and I&#8217;m mumbling and stuttering.<br />\nThe Adobe engineer holds up his hands to me. &#8220;Don&#8217;t freak out, he&#8217;s a robot but it&#8217;s not AI.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;m actually still in San Fransisco.&#8221; Smiles the Google man. &#8220;This is a prototype, I thought I give a try. It&#8217;s called a Mobile Avatar. I have three of them in different cities around the world. Makes arriving to meetings a bit more bearable&#8211;saves fuel, and I get to stay at home :)&#8221; He actually draws a smiley face in the air, two dots followed by a swoosh. It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve seen a <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gesticon&#038;defid=0\">gesticon</a>. It&#8217;s the new trend with kids these days. Evidently, Google man wants to be hip.<br />\nI marvel at the smoothness of movement and the realism of the robot.<br />\nThe engineer tinkers with the inside of the Avatar&#8217;s chest as he explains, &#8220;We realized it wasn&#8217;t worth making the AI to go along with our bots, but we could market them as vessels for people to be halfway around the world without actually going anywhere. Our clients, stay at home, step into a suit that picks up on every movement and transfers those signals to this machine.&#8221;</p>\n",

Just when I start to get comfortable, this giant Turkey-Dog&trade; growls at me from only a few meters away. I stopped eating mammals years ago. The genetic similarities with humans are too great and it feels too much like cannibalism. Something about meat growing hair and having live birth just doesn&#8217;t taste right to me anyway. I&#8217;ve wrestled with the notion that these lab grown Turkey-Dog&trade; types are not really mammals. Even though they have a head of a dog, they still lay eggs and are covered (even on the head) in feathers.</p>\n<p>While I&#8217;m pondering if my hunger is great enough to attempt to eat this thing&#8211;assuming I can stop it from eating me, the beast starts to dig in the ground with it&#8217;s thin, sharp talons. Everything in this forest is ravenous. I can hear the sweet little birds in the trees, muttering to each other and placing bets. They would be frothing with hunger if they could.</p>\n<p>Time is up. The Turkey-Dog&trade; runs at me and I have no choice but to scamper backwards through the loud autumn leaves. They crunch under my feet and I am certain the lion will hear us. Maybe I can outrun my pursuer and leave him to the lion.<br />\nI turn, facing the direction of my departure and notice a shallow but frantic stream. Wading into it, the water attempts to topple me over. I&#8217;m too big to succumb to the furious but diminutive rapids but the Turkey-Dog&trade; is not. He follows me in and is quickly and unwittingly pulled in by the stream. He isn&#8217;t drowning but he can&#8217;t fight away the water, which is carrying him swiftly away from me. I trudge after him. That&#8217;s my meal. It&#8217;s been decided. That beast is mine.</p>\n<p>Now we are at the bottom of the river, which ends abruptly next to a large granite rock. There are sharp granite stones all around my feet and I grab one the size of a grapefruit, with the intent to lob it at my meal&#8217;s head. The Turkey-Dog&trade; inches out of the water, tired and beaten by the force of gravity. He curls up next to my feet and whimpers. I heave the rock firmly, aiming straight for the head. It misses. It misses by almost a meter. The thing is right next to me and my arms are weak and useless. That&#8217;s how hungry I am. I pick up the rock and try again several times. Each time, the rock flies over the beast&#8217;s head by such a distance as to make me seem incompetent. Meanwhile, the animal just lays there, looking at me, as if I&#8217;ve saved it&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>Before I&#8217;m ready to give up eating this thing, I realize that I&#8217;m not alone. A woman is here at the bottom of the river and she&#8217;s laughing at my attempts to kill the creature at my feet.<br />\n&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; She snickers.<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to eat this thing.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;If you are that hungry, we have food.&#8221; She says, sincerely.<br />\nThe Turkey-Dog looks up at me with wide obedient eyes. It seems I have a new friend.</p>\n",

What if something happened to both of them? What would I do?<br />\nI&#8217;ve been thinking about these things a lot lately. Not just even about the baby but suddenly, what if my brother died? What about my mom? or my sister? Would I be able to keep working? Would I move to Thailand and become a monk?<br />\nSome part of me (the tactless, villainously selfish portion of my brain) thinks, &#8220;at least they still have Ella&#8221;. How they would be able to hold together and remain human if they didn&#8217;t, I hope will remain a mystery.</p>\n<p>I am amazed at the strength the Kowalczyk family has managed to muster and praise their close friends and relatives for keeping them sane.

    "content": "<p>The Nursing Online Education Database just posted a list of <a href=\"http://noedb.org/library/features/50-tips-and-resources-to-help-you-sleep-better\">50 sleeping tips</a>. It&#8217;s a nice list with some really great things to try if you want to experiment with your sleep in subtle ways.</p>\n<p>Keeping in mind that I am not a nurse nor a doctor, I still have some comments based on my own sleep experiences. I find it necessary to comment because <i>very</i> little scientific research has actually been done on sleep. Personal experiences add a necessary supplement to the modicum of information out there.</p>\n<p><b>#5. Don&#8217;t go to bed with a full stomach</b><br />\nWhen attempting to get an 8 hour night of continuous sleep, I think this is one of the most important factors of having a both a restful night of sleep and an easy awakening without feeling groggy. Food digestion slows with the rest of your body functions at night and if you have food in your stomach at all, it will sit there for as long as you do. I have always felt groggy and unrested, regardless of how much sleep I get, in times that I have eaten before bed. I have been in the habit lately of actually staying up later (and getting less hours of sleep) just to insure that I rid my body of all food before going to sleep. It has paid off remarkably.</p>\n<p><b>#14. Never go to bed hungry</b><br />\nI have to disagree slightly with this one. While, in my experience, going to bed starving or even with a blatant hunger is not a good idea, being right on the verge of getting hungry and leaning on the side of hunger has been quite a good experience for me.<br />\nWhen I was working dinner shifts in the restaurant industry, going to school during the day, I was on a fairly strict schedule. I ate dinner a little after 5pm and had a small snack (and plenty of water) during my shift. My work shift was great exercise&#8211;resulting in plenty of sweat and sore muscles throughout the week. I was always incredibly tired when I got off work between 12:30-1am.  I went to bed a little hungry at about 2am and I would always wake up at about 8am or 9am, jumping out of bed with energy and feeling very ready to start the day (stopping at the kitchen before the shower). For breakfast, I always had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (every day for over 9 months). Being allergic to milk gives me fun alternatives to the normal American breakfast cereal morning.<br />\nI was on that schedule for about 9 months, sleeping 6-7 hours a night consistently. I remember feeling more alert, better rested and happier than I have on any other sleeping regiment&#8211;even than the year I spent working graveyard, sleeping a consistent 10 hours a night, in which I had the best, longest, most vivid dreams that I could ever remember and even experienced my first lucid dreams.</p>\n<p><b>#25. Take Melatonin</b><br />\nI tried Melatonin once and aside from vivid dreams and feeling well rested in the morning, it wasn&#8217;t a great experience (read <a href=\"http://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/2007/04/24/melatonin-or-lcd/\">Melatonin or LCD</a>).<br />\nLast November, Science Daily published an article called < a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071115164438.htm\">Hormone of Darkness: Melatonin Could Hurt Memory Formation At Night</a>, which announces new sleep studies on zebra fish (grain of salt: they are <i>not</i> mammals, which <i>may</i> be important).<br />\nNow, there are other articles and research studies on mice (mammals) that show the opposite&#8211;that Melatonin actually may improve learning.<br />\nI decided to try Melatonin after reading the very detailed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin\">Melatonin Wikpedia article</a>, which convinced me that it was worth trying and I may try it again since I still have a bottle of 2 stage release tablets.<br />\nTalk About Sleep has a great <a href=\"http://www.talkaboutsleep.com/circadian-rhythm-disorders/circadian-rhythm-sleep-disorders/10-how-to-use-melatonin-correctly.htm\">article on correct use of Melaton</a><br />\nI recommend to anyone wanting to experiment with it, to read all of the links within this post :)</p>\n",

It takes some time before I figure out that it&#8217;s just folded up and compressed in a few places. Some of the parts need to be twisted and turned like a Rubik&#8217;s Cube.<br />\nI&#8217;m standing there with my head down, fumbling with the gadget when I hear, rather than see, the buffer overflow. They&#8217;ve come in through the front entrance and already taken a few hostages. Looking up, I see the leader with a long black coat and sunglasses. Cute&#8230;[insert sardonic emoticon here]. The flyboys with him are Turkish squatters, leaking out into the aisles like waves of animated baggy corduroy. They move quickly but the aisles are long.<br />\nI see another like me, with a weapon like mine. He smoothly launches it in the air where the box unfolds against the air resistance, mechanically recompiling itself into a firearm. As he begins his assault, I give mine the same treatment. It doesn&#8217;t work for me the first time because I don&#8217;t throw it high enough. I have to launch it into the air a couple of times before it completely unfolds. On the final spin and catch I pull it close to my face, careful to aim at the leader. Through the circular lens in the front I can see him closely. My left hand steadies my right arm but he&#8217;s too far away. I can&#8217;t get a dead lock but I fire anyway for practice. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve used one of these contraptions. It misses, spraying a payload of half a dozen holes in the wall, several meters from my target.<br />\nThe activity alerts the pack of my location and I tally ho, back and forth, unsure where to maneuver. The flyboy rats are descending quickly and I decide to make a stand. The weapon aimed, I fire right at the adrenaline infused miscreant mass. The gun does nothing. Not even a click, click, click as I frantically and insanely try again and again to riddle with holes the scurrying forces of ill intent.</p>\n",

I&#8217;ve already got so much I haven&#8217;t listened to.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Get the instrument, man. For a hundred bucks you can&#8217;t pass it up. You&#8217;ll never find another like it. Say it with me man, Electric-Guitar. Nobody has seen one of these things in forever man! It&#8217;s claa-ssic, man! It&#8217;s got strings and all.&#8221;<br />\nHe tempts me with the antique but I&#8217;m here looking for some new tech&#8211;something I have <i>never</i> seen. But this guy hasn&#8217;t got anything like that. I was syncing musical DNA before this little terminal stain was suckling his first drop of Infojuice&trade;.<br />\nI walk out into the bright Thai sunlight and met up with my friends. &#8220;Let&#8217;s swim through this mess,&#8221; I say in the cool vernacular of my day. My friends agree, but we need a map. We&#8217;ve never been to this part but Lena knows a bookshop in the area where we can get a secret map.<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s hidden in the cover of <i>The Beach</i>. I put it there last summer. Nobody will find it.&#8221; She assures.<br />\n&#8220;What if someone bought the book?&#8221; I query.<br />\n&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I had some cheap labor make copies in all the versions of the book&#8211;but even if someone finds it, they won&#8217;t understand it :)&#8221; She points at the air making two dots and a swish. She doesn&#8217;t need to smile anymore, her hands can do it for her. It&#8217;s the new rave that all the kids are doing, gestures for emotions. They say it let&#8217;s you stay young by never needing to wrinkle your face. Emote with your hands and never need ironing.<br />\nWhen we get to the bookshop, there&#8217;s only one copy of <i>The Beach</i> left. I fish under the cover of the book and find it. &#8220;Is this it?&#8221; The map doesn&#8217;t look all that special. It&#8217;s like a theme park map, something you would pick up at Space World with all the attractions in big cartoon pictures.<br />\n&#8220;That&#8217;s it. Let&#8217;s run.&#8221;<br />\nWe literally get lost so we can test out the map.<br />\n&#8220;OK, 3rd and Franklin, look it up.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;There is no 3rd on this map, it&#8217;s 10 years old. We&#8217;re standing on a dirt road. This was obviously built recently.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Let&#8217;s walk up a block then.&#8221; She suggests. We get up another block and end up in a stream, swimming with guppies and huge schools of little round fish. I snap photos while the tide carries us downstream.<br />\n&#8220;Hey, check out the walls around the river, they look like gargoyles.&#8221; I point and click. Around the mountains, half way in the water are midget sized gargoyles with octopus tentacle hair and huge alien eyes. Their bodies are fish like but they have little arms, no bigger than the tentacles on their heads. As I photograph and float on by, they start to lift their heads and watch us. One heads over and I realize it has a humongous head. &#8220;Does it speak telepathically,&#8221; I ask, to nobody in particular.<br />\n&#8220;How did you know.&#8221; My friend answers.<br />\n&#8220;Just a lucky guess, it doesn&#8217;t have a mouth but obviously they have bigger brains than we do.&#8221;<br />\nThe creature swims around me. It&#8217;s not threatening, just curious and eventually we exit it&#8217;s domain. The water carries us far.  </p>\n",

    "content": "<p>So my doorbell rings while we&#8217;re watching a movie and I run down the stairs with ambivalence. It&#8217;s either someone with info about my lost cat or another newspaper salesman. I start mentally preparing my speech, which I&#8217;ve given a few times and always results in a quick end to the sales pitch. It&#8217;s simple and to the point:<br />\n&#8220;Newspapers are old technology. I read the news online, the day before it goes to print. It&#8217;s a waste of resources and it&#8217;s not as good as the free alternative.&#8221;<br />\nAlthough I&#8217;ve been tempted, I&#8217;ve never offered what I suspect would be a catchy and accurate new slogan for the printed press, &#8220;Yesterday&#8217;s News, Today!&#8221;<br />\nMy goal is never to make enemies, just to make them go away.<br />\nOpening the door, I&#8217;m shocked to see a guy holding a black cat.<br />\n&#8220;Hey, I saw the posters up.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Is that&#8230;&#8221; I reach out for it, pulling the cat in for a closer look. &#8220;Oh, is that&#8230; it&#8217;s&#8230; wait&#8230;. it&#8217;s not him. He&#8217;s too small. A little young. But he looks <i>so</i> much like him&#8230;&#8221;<br />\nI set the cat on the ground and meet my neighbor, who&#8217;s name I instantly place wrong in my memory, later calling him Jake instead of Dave.<br />\nI thank him for bringing the cat anyway, &#8220;I wonder who&#8217;s he is, anyway&#8230;&#8221; I watch the cat as it sniffs around my porch.<br />\nAfter closing the door and running back upstairs, I tell Lena about the encounter.<br />\n&#8220;Are you sure it wasn&#8217;t him? Maybe he just lost a lot of weight.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t him, he was too young and different. It looked a lot like him though&#8230; Like Thor 3 or 4 years ago. I&#8217;ll go back and get him so you can see.&#8221;<br />\nI run back outside and see the cat across the street, sniffing at a tree. I pick him up and bring him inside. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t Thor. You&#8217;re too small and young. You smell different, too.&#8221;<br />\nI show Lena and she almost convinces me that it might be Thor, traumatized and different, lighter and more spry from the shock and activity of stray life for four days.<br />\nCassiopeia hisses and the new cat is way too playful to be Thor. He smells around the house and doesn&#8217;t understand the cat door leading into the garage without my help, holding it open for him. He eats and plays, very friendly and looking comfortable but unfamiliar the whole while. It&#8217;s not him. But what do we do? He doesn&#8217;t have a collar. He might be a stray. He might be someone&#8217;s lost cat, just like our Thor. Maybe the people who lost him took our cat in by mistake. They look remarkable alike. We could take him to the shelter and tell them if nobody claims him to call us&#8230; then we could figure out what to do with him&#8230; damn, it&#8217;s Sunday and the shelter is closed. Why do they make it so difficult?<br />\n&#8220;Maybe I can take it outside and follow it around back to it&#8217;s house&#8230;&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;OK&#8221;, Lena is too tired with an ear infection.<br />\nI take the cat out and for a while he doesn&#8217;t do anything but circle a car parked in front of our house, weaving in and out of the tires and occasionally coming back to our porch to sniff around some more. Eventually, I urge him to follow me away from the car. He strolls over noncommittally to the fence across the way, exploring all the while, battering rocks and sticks, chewing on twigs and doing Parkour around the fence and telephone polls. Several times he leaps onto a phone poll, straddling it with his forepaws outstretched and jumps to get higher in little bursts of bear hug furry. He&#8217;s certainly wild. He knows how to work the outside. Darting in and out of a hole in the fence, he shows me around the area. I lose him for a while as he travels the other side of it so I run around the block. Maybe he lives in that house. I could ask them. When I get to the house, there is a man coming home.<br />\n&#8220;Do you have a black cat?&#8221; I ask.<br />\n&#8220;No, there are some posters though.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Yeah, that ones mine, but I saw another one that&#8217;s too small and doesn&#8217;t have a collar. I just want to make sure he has a home. Oh, there he is.&#8221; The little cat runs from the back yard of the neighboring house up to me.<br />\n&#8220;Where?&#8221; the man looks around, not seeing the cat.<br />\n&#8220;Right there.&#8221; I point to it as he runs up into my arms.<br />\nThe man still doesn&#8217;t see the cat around but congratulates me on finding it and says &#8220;good luck&#8221; finding my other cat.<br />\nI thank him and take the cat back. Every few houses, he makes a curious sound and I set him down to walk alongside me. He doesn&#8217;t run away, just along. We get back to my house and he comes inside when I open the door. He plays with yarn and we wonder how we can manage taking him to the shelter since they close at 6pm. After a while, I decide to take him out again.<br />\nIt&#8217;s darker so I bring a flashlight and a laser pointer.<br />\nThis time, the cat heads over in the other direction. I follow him to the back parking area of the townhouses behind us. He makes a daring jump onto a high fence and I follow him with the flashlight as he goes to0 far for me to follow. After losing track of him, I get a little worried and run around the block to the other side of the fence. There&#8217;s a lot of space back there and I circle the houses around that area until I&#8217;m sure he must have gone back to where we started. Again, I run around the block, this time exhausted as I approach my house.<br />\nOut of the corner of my eye, behind a fire hydrant, next to the hole in the fence, I see him.<br />\n&#8220;puuRreow&#8221;, I call but he begins to retreat into the hole as I approach. &#8220;Hey, come on, where you goin&#8217;?&#8221;<br />\nI get closer and I notice he looks a little tense and scared. He&#8217;s different. He looks bigger, bigger eyes, different meow. I reach down and pick him up and I&#8217;m fully certain. This is Thor. The other cat is nowhere in sight and I take my cat home.</p>\n",

He had been catnapped by a neighbor and given away as a gift. We found the people who took him through some clues left behind at the scene. We took it home and pieced together who they were and why they did it.<br />\nHalf-way through the night, I woke up disappointed, realizing it didn&#8217;t really happen.<br />\nLater, I dreamed that I found him across the street, in a dark cave-like crevasse. I could see his green eyes light up inside it and when I meowed at him, he came running out. I woke again, several times, disappointed that the place I found him in my dream doesn&#8217;t really exist. I dreamed and awoke not realizing that I was still asleep in each waking. After dream frustration, I got up and ran out to find the area that I had dreamed about. It was just across the street from the house. I found the small cave underneath a pond and surely he was there. I woke up Lena with him in my arms and she was amazed to see him. She wanted to know where I found him so we went out to the spot, Thor still held tight.<br />\nAs Lena was examining the area, the wind started blowing extremely hard.<br />\n&#8220;Is this where you found him?&#8221; Lena shouted over the wind.<br />\n&#8220;Come over here, we need to head back.&#8221; I screamed.<br />\nWe were only a couple blocks away from the house and I hit the crosswalk button with my foot, clutching Thor with my hands.<br />\n&#8220;The wind is picking up, we need to get out of this hurricane! I don&#8217;t want to lose him again!&#8221; This last part felt strange, like a sappy movie quote.<br />\nThe cars and trucks driving past us started to drive much faster. A massive truck went by, floating several feet off the ground. A Metro bus passed us with only one wheel remaining, floating in the middle of the undercarriage. It had lost all the others from skidding over the sidewalks at magnificent speeds and smashing it&#8217;s parts into the sides of the concrete. Pieces of vehicles started to glide by us and drift off the cars and trucks as they came by.<br />\nI pushed against the wind, holding myself on the ground with the weight of my guilt for losing Thor.<br />\nA car went by sideways, parts flying and riping off it. Lena exclaimed, &#8220;yes, you <i>are</i> dangerous,&#8221; to the driver, as if he was spinning out for fun&#8211;and he may have been.<br />\nTime slowed and we used it to our advantage, navigating between parts of the flying wreckage, like a giant 3D Frogger but instead of cars and logs, it was massive pieces of automotive shrapnel.<br />\nWe eventually made it inside the house but then I realized I must still be asleep. Thor was home and the world outside was in windy chaos. The streets were coming up off the road and telephone polls where I had stuck the &#8220;Missing Cat&#8221; posters were being eaten by the Nothing.<br />\nI woke up for the last time, &#8220;I&#8217;m working from home today&#8211;so I can look for Thor&#8230;&#8221; I told Lena.<br />\nWe&#8217;ll find him.</p>\n",

We can cut your monthly bill in half&#8230;&#8221;<br />\nI said, &#8220;tempting, but I&#8217;m switching to Clearwire. The modem is already in the mail.&#8221;<br />\nI knew that I was going to take a performance hit by going to Clearwire, moving down fron 9Mb/3Mb to 1.5Mb/768Kb. That was a sacrifice I could make to be a part of the wireless broadband revolution.<br />\nI lowered my standards of broadband because Clearwire was a cool company and I was proud to tell people about it.<br />\nSeveral months went by and Clearwire worked fine. A few minor outages for a short period were the only setbacks&#8211;something I expected from a new, growing broadband provider.</p>\n<p>Having just moved 3 miles closer to downtown Seattle, I was sad to find that my new house does not get Clearwire service. I was so disappointed. I wanted to keep my Clearwire modem. Sure it&#8217;s much slower than cable but they will have Wi-Max soon (One reason I wanted to joined in the first place). I didn&#8217;t want to leave but I had no choice. Clearwire can&#8217;t service me. </p>\n<p>I called Support and explained my situation.<br />\n&#8220;You will have to have someone take over your contract to avoid paying the early termination fee of $195. I can give you the number of someone in your local market who has a list of people you could transfer it to.&#8221;<br />\nI get transferred. I talk to Sean. Sean has no idea what the support rep in Florida is talking about. He says he&#8217;ll get back to me after he researches it. Several days later I get a voice mail that he doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s talking about and if he can be of any other assistance to let him know&#8211;meanwhile explaining that his department didn&#8217;t handle that kind of thing and I would be better off talking to someone else.</p>\n<p>Well, damn. I don&#8217;t have time to be a Clearwire salesman. I&#8217;ve already told my friends and family about Clearwire and I work at a Web startup company&#8211;all my friends and co-workers already have internet with higher speeds and better uptime (and after mentioning my predicament to my co-workers, I found that Clearwire didn&#8217;t have the good reputation I expected amongst my peers). So, I was stuck. I can&#8217;t find someone to take my contract&#8211;and I don&#8217;t want to shove it on someone else&#8217;s plate if they are going to get this kind of treatment. So I call back.</p>\n<p>Many times, I talk to them and get thrown back and forth, called back, disconnected, etc&#8230; </p>\n<p>Finally, after a long negotiation, someone says I can schedule a technician to come to my house and verify that I don&#8217;t have a signal. If the tech finds no signal, I won&#8217;t have to pay the fee. Ok, great, let&#8217;s do it.</p>\n<p>I get the guy to come over on Friday evening. I leave work a half hour early to meet the guy. He doesn&#8217;t show up until half an hour past the appointment time. He wanders through the house, up and down all three floors and finally concludes that, indeed, I have no service. Great, I did that myself on day 1. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Monday, I call Clearwire again. This time, they say that it doesn&#8217;t matter. I still have to pay the fee because I&#8217;m under contract at my old address. I tell them to have someone call me back who can influence this policy. This is, I say, the one reason I will not go back to Clearwire in the future. I&#8217;m on a 2 year moving plan. I expect to sometimes not get service and I will have to change over&#8211;but I&#8217;m not going back to Clearwire if this is what I can expect from them. It&#8217;s not worth my time or energy.</p>\n<p>Today, I get a call back from Matt at Level 2 support.</p>\n<p>Since I wasted (and was charged for) a month with no service, trying to get my plan canceled at a reasonable cost, Matt from Level 2 was able to refund this last month of service fees. <i>yay</i>. It&#8217;s great that they don&#8217;t charge customers for a month of service they didn&#8217;t give, but I still wasted many hours on the phone with Clearwire and left work early to meet a guy at my house. In the end, they still want me to pay the early termination fee to kill my contract that extends until July of 2009. </p>\n<p>So, I&#8217;ve already wasted $200 worth of my time and I&#8217;m paying another $195 to get the Clearwire monkey off my back. Needless to say, however excited about Wi-Max I may be, I&#8217;m not going back to Clearwire anytime soon&#8211;and although I recommended Clearwire to friends and family before, I am now on a mission to rant to everyone about how bad this customer service situation was for me. Maybe Clearwire will be better in the future but they are going to have to extend more than a welcome handshake and a bill for service if they want me to join them again.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>In the shallow ocean, I&#8217;m lifting mussels and sea-snails from the bed. Multicolored, shiny, they swim away, extending thin pneumatocyst filled anemone strands, like little Cthulu tentacles reaching for freedom. They roll in and out of the shells, extending with great length and gracefulness, gliding around the water.<br />\n&#8220;Look at that.&#8221; I point to a bright orange one I just picked up.<br />\n&#8220;When do we get to dive into the water?&#8221; Says a member of the group. I&#8217;m teaching a diving course and for some reason everyone thinks I mean Olympic diving rather than scuba diving. I give in and drag a tall diving platform out into the water and everyone climbs up to the top. It&#8217;s just floating on the water, somehow buoyant, unanchored. I check the water level and note that we are still too shallow to have someone dive off the platform. They would certainly see some great shellfish but too quickly and with an abrupt end.<br />\nI push the platform further out into the ocean and then realize that we aren&#8217;t tied to anything on shore. We could float away with the tide. There is no tide. That is the strange part about this ocean. Perfectly calm, it has no waves, like a vast and open salt-water swimming pool. I tie the platform up to something on the shore, but only a little bit. The divers are so eager, I don&#8217;t have time to do it properly. </p>\n<p>In a restaurant above the water, it&#8217;s valentine&#8217;s day and a couple celebrates. Their food is terrible and their service is worse. I am waiting tables there.<br />\nWe are playing a board game and I put all the pieces in the wrong place. &#8220;It&#8217;s a game like Roborally but with bots&#8221;. Nobody is very excited because they don&#8217;t like Roborally.</p>\n<p>At my grandmother&#8217;s house, a band wakes up early to jam. They are playing Beatles songs with a punk overtone and I wish I brought my accordion because I could certainly jam with them. They record on Protools and sing like demons. I worry that they will wake my grandparents but then I figure they have already left for the day.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m killing time in a book store. The shop keeper has several old and valuable books for quite reasonable prices but I cannot get them because I am moving. I&#8217;ll get them later, I promise myself. The back half of the book store is a comic shop. I step in to kill a few minutes but it&#8217;s closed. As I open the door a short punk girl comes over and asks if she can help me.<br />\n&#8220;I was just seeing if the comic store is open.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Oh, no it&#8217;s closed today, didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Oh, right, it&#8217;s Sunday,&#8221; I mumble, &#8220;or, no, it&#8217;s Monday but it&#8217;s a holiday, right&#8230;&#8221;<br />\nAs I&#8217;m leaving a guy is pointing to some comics on a shelf in the bookstore. It&#8217;s Elfquest and he says he has digital copies of the series on his iPhone, but he says it in a French accent so I expect his comics were in French too.</p>\n<p>Taking the bus home, I get off later than usual. I want to head further north. I take my shirt off in the summer heat and I grab up at a Thai style tree branch. There are countless birds in the trees and they swarm away from me from tree to tree.<br />\nSoon, I realize that they are not running away but leading me. They fly closer to my head and I reach out. They land on my shoulder, my hands. They try to teach me the best way to approach them but I&#8217;m slower than they are. Suddenly, I&#8217;m looking down at someone else. He&#8217;s acting very slow, some might say moronic. He doesn&#8217;t get the birds perspective&#8211;the birds-eye-view. They try to communicate but he doesn&#8217;t understand. They show him a calendar they made and he reads it wrong, looking at the French instead of the English side. He doesn&#8217;t know any french and thinks they must have invented a new language. He reads it horribly aloud. He becomes their protectorate knight. He recruits a half dozen followers, some of which think he is insane. He stays with the birds until the great bird Armageddon, wearing a knight suit and carrying a great sword.</p>\n",

The wind catches the umbrella and sweeps it out from under me. I grab on, spilling raspberries as it carries me into the air. We are moving fast, the umbrella and I, keeping pace with the flowing river, which is now turning clear as it rolls across fresh grass.<br />\nFarmers are picking fruit on each side of the river and I realize that the water is following an intentionally mowed path between them. This water was intended to feed their patches and now that it is the right time of year, it has been unleashed.</p>\n<p>After about a mile or so, the water runs out, the river draining into the ground. I stay for a while in the summer sunshine, playing with the umbrella. I jump into the air, extremely high, only to float down slowly until the wind resistence finally snaps the umbrella inside out and I come rushing down. In my descent I thrust the umbrella out at the ground and it turns back into a floating boat, tick-tocking me to a safe landing. Farmers children laugh and wonder at my mastery of the umbrella so I show them some more tricks. Pealing back the wireframe so that it looks like an exploded tortoise shell, I rotate it quickly and throw the umbrella into the air. It twirls and on it&#8217;s way down, it rotates upside down, snaps back into it&#8217;s normal shape and rolls once more to land in my hand.</p>\n<p>It seems I play like this until the sun goes down and everyone leaves.

The most important thing to know about a function is what it eats and what it excretes.<br />\nIn the case of this function, which has a silly name &#8220;is default profile exists&#8221; (understandable but excessively worded in bad grammar), it&#8217;s not apparent what it eats. It&#8217;s plainly obvious that &#8220;ownerNickName&#8221; is the &#8216;username&#8217; or &#8216;nickname&#8217; of the profile &#8216;owner&#8217; (although, it would suffice to call this variable &#8220;NickName&#8221;, which would be lighter code and make just as much sense in the context of the function.<br />\nThe first variable though is</p>\n<p>1.

    "content": "<p>I have a little hand sized crow bar and Iâ€™m prodding the door frame of a red Lamborghini. I can get a portion of the door to split away enough that I can make out the artificial looking interior. Frantically, I make my way around the car, prodding every orifice that I can cram the crow bar into, peeling back and bending the metal.<br />\nâ€œDonâ€™t fuck with the techno-geeks,â€ Iâ€™m muttering, â€œweâ€™ll tear your shit up.â€<br />\nThe guy who owns the Italian beauty comes running out. Somehow, he thinks Iâ€™m doing him a partial service because he lost his keys and wouldnâ€™t have been able to get in had I not twisted the door frame enough for him to reach in and unlock the door. He quickly hops into the left door and sits in the driverâ€™s seat, which happens to be on that side of the car. He grabs a towel and crams it up to the door frame where I have bent the door into a gaping hole.<br />\nâ€œI think itâ€™ll be alright. Thanks for your help.â€ He says, handing me a tip and closing the door. The door makes a quiet padded thud against the towel and it looks almost like it will heal from the disastrous mutilation of my iron.<br />\nAs the driver revs the engine, I grab the hood of the car, just next to the door and prepare to skate along-side the car. He jams it up to 60 in a blink of an eye and Iâ€™m sliding, attached with one strong arm. I try to scream a warning that the wind speed is tearing the door frame off the car, but itâ€™s too late. The driverâ€™s door falls slightly at the hinge, a slow-mo warning, delayed by dynamic secondsâ€“just enough to think, â€œoh, noâ€. Then it rips off is tumbling through the air behind us at a magnificent lack of speed.<br />\nâ€œHoly Gamblerâ€™s Fallacy!â€ screams the driver. He stops the car as abruptly as the door vanished and I go forward, continuing at 60. My skates have retracted and Iâ€™m sliding on the soles of my shoes to slow down. Luckily the road is covered in slick rain so the pavement doesnâ€™t rip apart my feet and I glide to a halt with anime action hero prowess.</p>\n<p>Later, Iâ€™m telling my high school friend, J, about the dream. Heâ€™s amused but gets worried when my visual demonstration of the slide-to-a-halt part sends me careening down a guard rail toward him and some strangers at dangerous speeds. I grab the rail and slow to a stop to alleviate his fretting.<br />\nâ€œIt was a really cool dream!â€ I exclaim.<br />\nWe leave the museum where my friend is able to leave his embarrassment. Thereâ€™s a free monthly event he knows of that has free food and drinks. He ushers me to the building and tells me to act like Iâ€™m there to get a stock analysis.<br />\nâ€œWhat kind of stock analysis?â€ I wonder and ask.<br />\nâ€œIt doesnâ€™t matter. Nobody will actually talk to you. Just act like thatâ€™s why youâ€™re here.â€<br />\nâ€œOKâ€¦â€ Puzzled but adventuresome, I follow him up the elevator to a banquet hall where men in suits, portfolio folders outstretched, are chatting with housewives and construction workers. There is free beer, wine and cookies on a table and my friend starts to pile handfuls of desserts into his pockets. I grab a couple of beers, one open and one for the road. â€œItâ€™s too bad they just have cookies. Iâ€™m going to assume they arenâ€™t vegan and not risk an allergic death. You know of a lot of these kinds of events?â€<br />\nâ€œHell, yeah!â€ He whispers in excitement, â€œthis is how Iâ€™ve been eating for the last 3 months, bitch.â€<br />\nâ€œOhâ€¦okâ€¦umâ€¦donâ€™t you have a job and get paid and whatnotâ€¦â€<br />\nâ€œYeah, well, itâ€™s sort of a protest to the man,â€ he explains. I stop the inquisition there. I donâ€™t want to hear his tirade about starving people again. He continues back to the original topic, â€œI know of another fancier one. They probably have sandwiches and stuff. Letâ€™s go check it out.â€<br />\nWe head uptown to this gathering, up on the top floor of some business downtown. The whole floor looks more like a large, open honeymoon suite with no furniture. The carpet is white and the people are wearing pearls and holding their drinks with classy finger poses. Thereâ€™s a piano player and heâ€™s tinkling some mellow, unrecognizable tune that stinks of a bad remake.<br />\nMy friend grabs a sandwich and calls me over to the balcony where a bunch of people are talking about some kind of business issue. We start to mingle, adding in industry bull-shit as needed. Without warning an older gentleman at the balcony side pulls out a remote and presses a button, causing the balcony with all of us on it to jettison off the side of the building into the Puget Sound. When we hit the water, the balcony begins to sink and the old man curses.<br />\nâ€œWhy is it always that everyone has to come onto my boat? Why canâ€™t it just be me. Weâ€™re sinking and itâ€™s just because there are too many people on board!â€ He tries to push people off but itâ€™s too late. The balcony has receded below the sea worthy surface and soon we are just sitting in shallow pool of clear sea water. The water is strangely warm, comfortable, and clear. We sit and watch the fish and coral, all multicolored and in total shock that we have come to invade their world. Some of the fish are trapped, scared into a corner where the balcony and people separate them from freedom. They swim back and forth looking for an exit. Mentally I join them; physically I mingle with the other unfortunate victims of the balcony catastrophe.</p>\n",

They are living there like a massive bee city. They are flying over to the next block and picking up things we can&#8217;t make out from here, bringing them back to their hive. We walk further toward the pick-up spot for the bees goods and realize that the next block is a miniature city with miniature people. The people are being carried away by the bees. They run and hide and plan strange defenses that seem to do no good. In the distance, we notice the next block is made of giant flowers with multiple pollen bulbs on each stalk. It looks like the garden of flowers was made for the bees, if only the city of people weren&#8217;t in the way.</p>\n<p>We lure a few of the bees to the field of flowers. They orgasm in the flower bed for a while before returning to their hive, telling all the others, which then proceed to drop the little people and move on over the city to their proper destination. We too move on.</p>\n<p>Later at a music store, I&#8217;m looking for a new album&#8211;something I haven&#8217;t done in years. A friend who works at the counter tells me about this new one. It&#8217;s a two disc DVD set, audio album, mini-series, comic book and novella all in one. I flip through it and as I&#8217;m reading the comic-magazine, it changes in my hands to be a DVD case or an album or a comic.<br />\n&#8220;It&#8217;s made of a new nano-polycarbonate-artificial-life material. It responds to what you want it to be at the moment you touch it. then it shifts between 3-4 forms. Neat huh?&#8221; Says my friend.<br />\n&#8220;Yeah, neat. Cool story too. There&#8217;s everything in here behemoths and gods but mixed into a modern world. I dig it. Gotta go catch a movie. Later.&#8221;<br />\nI walk out the door and the street shifts in a strange way. It&#8217;s almost like Vertigo but then I realize it&#8217;s a hill forming on the road to the right. Cars start coming down the street, shocked at the sudden drop but they all make it down safely.</p>\n<p>At the theater, I hand the counter-girl my id and she prints out a movie ticket along with a cruise ticket. The name on the ticket says CorbinDalles (all one word) and I tell her that there are two things wrong with my ticket. First, the name should have a space in it. Second, that isn&#8217;t my name. She points to the girl next to me and indeed it&#8217;s Milla Jovovich who is holding up a multi-pass. I shrug and head into the theater. I was expecting to get the cruise ticket along with the movie stub. It&#8217;s part of my mission. I need to get on that ship and join up with my counterparts.<br />\nHalf-way through the movie, just when it was getting good, the theater becomes a dock and I&#8217;m boarding the ship. I can see my mates on board&mdash;about half a dozen of them. There&#8217;s a guy who looks a lot like Bruce Willis, except he&#8217;s dressed as a goth and he&#8217;s Chinese. He also has prawns instead of fingers on both hands. There&#8217;s a seedy looking guy who I know to be the one that pulled off &#8216;the job&#8217;. He has our money. There are the Ukrainian brothers and the German sisters.</p>\n<p>On the boat, we exchange our greetings and the guy who pulled the job pulls away to go below deck, fetching our money. When he returns, he has a wry grin, no money and a machine gun. Oh, the disappointment we all feel. It&#8217;s apparent in all of us. The man who was once to be our friend and who now had a gun on us goes down with a thud as the prawn fingered menace tackles him, swift as sight.</p>\n<p>I think we all die then or, at least, they all do.

    "content": "<p>We are in Thailand again, this time on a ship. Muslim extremists have tampered with the engine and it&#8217;s starting to spin wildly toward a pier. We jump at just the right moment before it hits. Just like in an action movie, it happens in slow motion. There is enough time to think about how I want to land in the water. It&#8217;s far enough down that it might hurt my fingers to do a normal dive approach. I bend my fingers half way so the knuckles at the middle of my fingers will hit the water instead of the tips. It doesn&#8217;t hurt but it doesn&#8217;t feel ideal when the water finally jams up into my hands.<br />\nUpon entering the water, I regret for a second that I forgot to bring my camera on this trip. Then I realize that if I had brought it, it wouldn&#8217;t have survived the ocean. It wouldn&#8217;t have been able to capture the water, pure and clear as air, housing a shallow pool of mussels, anemone, schools of baby octopodes and strange fish, all sharing the same space, seeming to be planted in rows as if a garden. I swish up out of the water like a dolphin to get a better look at the multi-colored panorama and cut my foot on a piece of coral. I can see the blood filling up the water as red as the bright starfish around me.<br />\nI hear a guide somewhere telling us to remember this spot. This is where we would always want to enter the ocean if coming through the canal. We should note the old painted rock and the broken opening to the sea. This is the easiest entrance, he said. Across the canal, an old building is covered in some of the most beautiful graffiti in Bangkok. Again, I curse not having my camera, useless as it would have been.<br />\nWe exit the water through the fjord and by the time we can walk rather than swim, night surrounds us.<br />\nAt a hotel we stayed in on our previous trip, the girl at the desk asks us what district we think we are in.<br />\n&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the Seoul district?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s not very safe. Do you have a reservation?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;No. If you don&#8217;t have a room, we&#8217;ll find another place.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Oh, that would be much too dangerous. The Korean district is run by the Korean mafia. It is full of gangs at night.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;You should come to Seattle.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I could give you a room but I will have to charge an extra room fee. I will have to create one for you.&#8221; I was starting not to like her fake smile. It feels like a grift. This place has changed.<br />\n&#8220;No thanks,&#8221; I say. It&#8217;s not worth the trouble.<br />\nOutside, we find ourselves in a bad neighborhood indeed. Vagrants are fighting over places to sleep, stopping only to glare at us as we pass. I suddenly become aware that my headphones are on and are connected to my iPod swinging at my hip. I tuck it into my pocket and slide my headphones around my neck. Several unsavories start following us and I realize why I&#8217;m here in Thailand. I&#8217;m on a mission. There is a gun in my pocket and I reach for it. Falling back and twisting, I fire it at one of the men following me. The gun, I realize, is a movie gun. It only fires bullets in variable slow motion. I have to plan on where people will be and how the action will impact the timing effect of the bullet in order to get a successful hit. I fire on all sides, hoping to lure the men into the place they need to be and some of the bullets mistakingly hit the outer walls of a power plant. The silos of the plant, noticing the security breach of bullet impact, activate their thrusters and begin their ascent into space. Fire spreads across the ground around us and we are all temporarily blind. I use this moment to fire again and this time I hit one of the men. Another man approaches me and fires but his gun is also a variable slow motion pistol. I dodge, he dodges, we exhaust our supply of bullets as he catches my last shot in his bare hands. Now we stand at an impasse, neither of us trained in hand to hand combat. The game is over. Nobody wins. He drops my bullet, smiles, and backs away.</p>\n",

It was late but never too late for the ruddy faced, lacquered and polished Irish in us, always ready to waltz in the moonlight if it meant a drink and a song at the end of the road.<br />\nWe didn&#8217;t make it to the concert. Somewhere on the way in a heated spatter-spit wit match we decided that love had torn us apart. We had no need to see the show; we were the show. What was Joy Division if not a melancholy reverberation of our daily lives, an echo of our times.<br />\nAt a party where it seemed the whole of Manchester was invited, we declared a new order of sound and experience. The only music now is improvised, from the moment and for the moment&#8211;never recorded because who would have time to listen when they would be making music of their own. Never again would we worship the dead, never again abandon our own creative impulses in reverence of another. And so it happened that on that one night all of Manchester sung as one, danced as many, and lived for the moment.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Well, here it is, 40 hours of travel ahead of us (with a 12 hour layover in Korea) and our last day to shop and hang in Thailand.</p>\n<p>We discovered something very interesting yesterday. We decided not to go back to the backpacker area of Banglampoo and instead stay near the Skytrain so we could wake up early and go to Jatujak weekend market this morning. That was the plan.<br />\nShortly after checking in in the Siam Center area, we walked around to refamiliarize ourselves with the area. Having the rest of the day ahead of us, we were in no hurry and we stopped to see Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix at the Scala Theater (Bangkok&#8217;s most classic theater&#8211;more beautiful and comfortable than any theater I&#8217;ve been to in the USA). The movie was nice because we spent many nights on Koh Samui island at a place called Will Wait Restaurant, watching pirated movies with our dinner. Most were ridiculously low quality theater recordings but it was funny to watch the bad subtitles that must have been generated by speech-to-text software in the TV. It was also nice because for the best seats in the house, it was about $3.50 US to see the movie. Aside from the 3 ushers with flashlights who kept guiding latecomers to their seats and shining random spots of distracting brightness all over the place, I&#8217;d say it was an excellent movie going experience.</p>\n<p>Oh, but before the movie started, we went to Pantip Plaza, which was a little hard to find on foot but we asked directions from many street vendors (and at a 7-11 where we purchased some awesome movie snacks&#8211;yummy candied tamarind).<br />\nPantip Plaza is the Tech Mall (I have pictures I will upload later). What you find when entering Pantip is that it&#8217;s 5-6 floors of pirated software, movies, music and games, electronic goods both new and refurbished and just about any other geeky thing you can imagine. Imagine a pirate mega-mall. It was cool. I was a little disappointed upon further investigation that the new items were the same price you would expect to pay in the USA (after doing the conversion)&#8211;some were even more expensive. When it comes to high-end technology, the equivalent value formula for cash consciousness goes crazy.</p>\n<p>Anyway, after the movie, we decided to check out MBK, the shopping mall that we didn&#8217;t make it to last time we were in this area. We gave up early last time because Siam Center is a very expensive yuppy area. However, we were delighted to find that inside MBK, on the Skytrain entrance level (the 3rd floor, I think), was a huge area just like Jatujak market, in which the hawkers bargained just as low and sometimes lower than we experienced anywhere else including JJ Market. We were blown away. Last time we went to JJ weekend market, we almost died because it&#8217;s all outside in non-air-con huts and there are so many people, you almost get trampled trying to find your way around the maze. And here in Yuppyville MBK was the same set of cheap items at the same prices. So, of course, we went crazy and blew a couple thousand baht. Then we decided to ditch JJ market in the morning and simply go back to MBK. This decision was amplified after we realized that we had spent over 2 hours just in the 3rd floor market and that MBK is actually a MEGA-mega-mall holding at least 6 floors, each about 1 kilometer long. We had dinner at the food court&#8211;complete with 2 beers&#8211;for 170 Baht together (or about $5 US). Shockingly the mall food was as good as any other food we&#8217;ve found around the area. </p>\n<p>Today, we went back to MBK and found that the market stalls weren&#8217;t open at the same time as the rest of the mall. Were they setup, the booths were closed off with garage door covers that were themselves covered in graffiti. I took as many pictures as I could and cursed not arriving before the dozen or so who had already opened, thereby concealing the amazing art on their closed doors. Oddly, the Siam Center area as classy and yuppy as it is is also the spot in Thailand with the most graffiti. I found another car park that was covered 360 degrees on the inside. I&#8217;ll have to go back there today.</p>\n<p>Well, we are off again to explore the rest of MBK. I need to get a couple more awesome shirts and whatnots. There is also a music store, which had guitars for between 1K-4K Baht or about $30-120US. I&#8217;m tempted, even though Lena claims my accordion, harmonica, drums, and electric guitar don&#8217;t get played enough. But I&#8217;m thinking I should sell my electric guitar and get an accoustic :)</p>\n<p>I know this is a little disjointed but I&#8217;ll be writing much much more when we get back and I can upload all the photos.

The hidden bangkok is really not far from the tourist streets but there are no tourists there. It would seem that all tourists take a taxi or a Tuk-Tuk to get anywhere. Just a couple blocks from the main roads, we found rows of market stalls and restaurants with more authentic foods, people and goods than the tourist traps held.<br />\nOn the flip side, now that  we are on Koh Samui, we&#8217;ve found walking on the beach a wonderful way to spend the day but trying to get anywhere is pretty tough on foot. But again, just a couple blocks inland from the tourist resorts we found flea markets and food centers and even a really awesome Thai style BBQ buffet for 89 Baht (US $2.62).

Now it is Leo beer. All I know of it is that it&#8217;s light and the label is totally in Thai. While we drink, we watch American Dreamz on the restaurant television. It may or may not be pirated, but the odds are in favor of the former. Watching the people around us tends to be more interesting than the movie, which is a little on the silly side. Perfect choice though for the American tourist. An American movie that makes fun of the American way. It sort of feels like Khao San Road itself. Even the restaurant owners speak perfect English. It seems that English is the middle man language of tourists here. I heard a chinese woman  saying something in English to the Thai pharmacists the other day. Germans, Greek, Russians, Ukrainian, Dutch, Norwegian, and French. They are all speaking English to the Thai natives. Aside from on Koh Samui, where many signs are in Thai, English and German, it seems English is everywhere and the only middle ground. It&#8217;s a convenient system for those who speak English natively, but I  feel a little bad for all those who don&#8217;t. We&#8217;ve met several people from different countries and they always apologies for their English. I always reply with the same, &#8220;It&#8217;s better than my Czech&#8221;, or  Dutch, or Norwegian or whatever it is the other person speaks. </p>\n",

As the last two nights have shown, my affinity for the night has a faster acting recovery method than hers does. Of course, tonight, I too would be nearly napping without a bottle of Thai Red Bull spiking my mind with rapid thunder.<br />\nOur new nightly squat is closer to the busy action of tourist Bangkok, in the Banglampoo district&#8211;not on Khao San road but close. Cars screetch past frequently, bleepity-bleeping and randomly skidding to a halt as they avoid collision with pedestrians and feral animals roaming the night. Every attempt to cross a street in Bangkok is also an attempt on your life. Cars don&#8217;t have to avoid pedestrians but it might ruin their day, which is the only reason they avoid you.<br />\nThe lobby of Happy House is packed from dawn to dusk with tired farang (what the Thais call western foriegners), all sipping beer or fruit smoothies while fix-eyed to one or more of the many television screens, which show the pirated movie of the moment.<br />\nNow, I too have moved downstairs but all the farang have left. The televisions are now playing Thai news and the street seems void of tourists. The Inn staff is all sitting around a table chatting away. One comes over to ask if I want anything and I order a bottle of Thai Lipton Ice Tea. The label is all in Thai and the bottle has been recycled many times. I pay the 15 Baht right now. It&#8217;s too easy to get street vendors to take your money but when it comes to paying for food, restaurant staff vanishes when it comes time to take your cash. The culture here is strangely trusting for one that is full of so many tourist scams. The fruit stalls and jewelry booths are frequently unattended. At night, you can walk down a busy street and, if you needed to, snatch up almost anything you can imagine without being noticed. I guess tourists thieving is just not common here.<br />\nI feel like I should be smoking, sitting here on the edge of the street, writing in my moleskin about the Bangkok night. The ciggarette smoke, foul as it is, would hide the pestulent stench of the Chao Praya river. The humid monsoon season weather makes the polution in the air stick to your face, stabbing at your eyes.<br />\nAt the end of the street, I notice tourists popping in and out of a travel center, hoping perhaps to find paradise in a weekend tour. A cart wheels past with a large sign in English, &#8220;Mango Sticky Rice&#8221;. I&#8217;m momentarily tempted to stop the cart pusher and for 20 Baht (US$0.59) get my own 15 minutes of paradise.<br />\nI&#8217;m trying to absorb as much of the city as I can before we overnight bus our way to the tropical islands of the south&#8211;and certainly, with this humidity, I will be ocean-bathing Bangkok from my pores for weeks.<br />\nTurning to news, I&#8217;m curiously amused. In a country with a population of 62 million, with 80% being farmers, the television news is as sensational and crime-story driven as it is in the US. Now a bull has run loose and chases after a dozen people before being shot with a tranquilizer arrow and lassoed to safety. Now a girl has been attacked and raped in her own apartment and robed at knife point after that. A dramatic reinactment tells all as the victim gives her tale, the camera only showing the bottom half of her face for anonymity. Now Several People are having siezures in the street while 3-4 other people to each victim attempts to restrain and comfort the fallen. Now it looks like epilepsy but there are 3 victims, a man a woman and a child. Now it looks like heat stroke in the hot afternoon as one volunteer fans the shaking man. Now the victims are chanting and the fallen man stands up to dance and clap. Now it looks like a religious revival. Now another woman is being carried by four people while she kicks and screams in short, loud bursts.<br />\nNow a commercial, an anti-graffiti advertisement. The cafe across the way is blasting French lounge music with a female vocalist who often chooses to sing in English. Each passing motorbike sprays the air with soot.<br />\nThe news distracts with its transition animation of a red orb that looks too much like the eye of the HAL 9000 super computer, all flashed up with mesmerizing flickers of rotating red around a glossy center, a rapid whoosh sound accompanying a sudden glow.<br />\nThe tea and red bull are wearing off. If the air were more breathable, it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to stay up all night, but my eyes are burning.<br />\nTime to retire, retreat, reboot.</p>\n",

However, we walked there and on the way we found a series of streets with absolutely no white people or other foreigners. And even though there seemed to be only Thai nationals around us, the sidewalks were still filled with hawkers. This time selling rare coins, dentures, food, jewelry and precious statues&#8211;rather than t-shirts, tattoos, piercings, food, custom tailored suits and such.<br />\nTucked away, deep within a side alley, we discovered a little thai restaurant and had the best green papaya salads we&#8217;ve ever tasted. The spice levels were as the thai enjoy and I nearly died but the lime juice in the sauce balanced the flavor enough for me to regain my composure, realizing that I suddenly felt much cooler (in temperature and style).</p>\n<p>We checked out of the Bhiman Inn where we arranged our first 3 nights. It was terribly overpriced at 1400 THB* per night (about US$41). They had several luxuries including a swimming pool, a minibar and more, of which we never took advantage. Just a few blocks away, across from a fabulous thai massage spa (180 baht for 1 hour&#8211;roughly US$5.29), we checked into Happy House for 490 THB per night (US$14.41).<br />\n*For full sense of conversion, read my post on the value of the Thai baht (<a href=\"http://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/?p=93\">http://sleep.shadowpuppet.net/?p=93</a>)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d have to say the Thai massages are my favorite part so far (aside from the amazing food, which was our initial impetuous for choosing Thailand). We had one yesterday and one the day before. We will be getting another later today. My goal is to have a 1 hour massage every day we are here. The first one I had, they popped every bone in my spine and several in my neck and arms (not to mention my fingers and toes). I embarrassed Lena because I grunted and moaned through the second one. The Thais are very polite but also very conservative in dress and manners. Nobody else made a sound. I figured it was alright though because the person who was doing my massage kept smiling and laughing. They found tense muscles I didn&#8217;t even know I had. And certainly, if you get a thai massage, you don&#8217;t have any use for a chiropractor.</p>\n<p>I did manage to find a couple of hand drums and I will be getting at least 2, one for me and 1 for david if he wants it. The initial price I got out of them was 950THB (about US$30). I got them down to 850 and pleading for me to give them a lower price when I said 600 and walked away. It was apparently too low because they let me go. I&#8217;ll see how much they are at the weekend market :)</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>So, I had an epiphany while walking through the streets of Bangkok last night. I found a grocery store and noticed a pattern in the prices relating to the value of the item here and in the US.<br />\nIt appears that the Thai baht to the Thai is as the dime is to the US citizen. To illustrate, a bottle of water is 10 Baht. Any form of portable beverage is about 10-15 baht or $1-$1.50 in relative value. This realization has carried forward on everything I&#8217;ve purchased and considered purchasing. However, I also realized with this that the marvelous exchange rate of 34 Thai Baht  to US$1 is not as great as it seems. You aren&#8217;t actually increasing the value of your dollar by 34/1, it&#8217;s actually 3.4/1 (still very nice but not nearly as marvelous).</p>\n<p>This realization is also helpful when bartering items. If the asking price is 200 Baht, then you can think of it as $20 to the Thai. So if you would pay US$20 for the item normally, then the price makes sense. However, it the item is something you imagine paying US$10 to get in the states, then you shouldn&#8217;t buy it for anything more than 100 Baht.</p>\n<p>Sadly, looking back, I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;ve overpaid on a few items. It&#8217;s so easy to spend baht because of the exchange rate. It&#8217;s very important to realize that the value of a baht is not the same to the Thai people as the value of a dollar in the US.</p>\n<p>I did much better today though. All I&#8217;ve spent is 25 baht (or the equivalent value of $2.50&#8211;with an exchange rate of less than US$1) for coconut jelly (a whole young coconut shaved out and filled with something like a chilled coconut jello with huge chunks of coconut (very tasty), and a green papaya salad appetizer with Phad Thai for lunch (at the University) for 60 baht (or $6 equivalent value&#8211;converted to less than US$2).</p>\n<p>So to sum, if you are used to thinking of the value of things in terms of US dollars and you find yourself with a lot of Thai currency, just think of a 10 baht coin as a dollar, a 100 baht bill as a ten dollar bill and so on. You will find that the prices for everything are the same as in the US, only you multiplied the amount of money in your pocket.</p>\n",

We were so tired, we just took the 400 Baht offer to the hotel. The cabbie was nice and it worked out. I was expecting to pay between 300-400 Baht for the cab anyway. I figure there are really two options, you can insist that they use the meter and possibly get scammed as they drive around to increase the fee, or you can bargain a flat rate, in which the cabbie tries to get you to your destination as quickly and efficiently as possible. Granted, you might end up with a good cabbie that uses the meter and takes the good roads, but it&#8217;s hard not to look like an asshole when you&#8217;ve been flying for 20 hours  through 16 time zones.</p>\n<p>So, this morning, we slept from about 2:45am-5:30am Bangkok time (that&#8217;s 12:45pm-3:30pm yesterday, Seattle time). The air is so humid, when I put the bug spray and sunblock on I didn&#8217;t feel any different. My skin was alreay supersaturated. The hotel breakfast was good. We had the western style since the Thai option was chicken and rice and it just didn&#8217;t sound too good right then.</p>\n<p><b>Bank troubles</b><br />\nAt the airport, we wanted to take out some cash from First Horizon. Of course, our cards didn&#8217;t work for some reason, the bank says it was due to an invalid pin entry but neither mine nor lena&#8217;s card worked. So, after using this internet cafe, which is a measly 30 Baht for 80 minutes (less than $1 US), we&#8217;ve got to find a bank and get a &#8220;cash advance&#8221;. Yay!</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I&#8217;m at a basketball game, which is odd because I&#8217;m not into sports of any kind. I&#8217;m sitting out as part of the team, watching my side get humiliated. The opposition is way better and they are trying to make us look foolish and weak. I crouch down next to a teammate and express my frustration. &#8220;They&#8217;re at least 3 times better than we are. Look at the way they are attacking, they just wait with that huge guy and we can&#8217;t do anything about it. Then they play around a bit to show that we are inferior.&#8221; My teammate explains how wrong I am and tells me that we are about to win.<br />\nI don&#8217;t really follow what he&#8217;s saying. It&#8217;s sports talk and I never understood the rules well enough to follow.<br />\nThere&#8217;s a very pretty girl in the crowd, next to me.<br />\nI walk out of the building and realize I&#8217;m at a University. It seems to be in some other country; the architecture is like nothing around here. The school museum has a giant circular garden in the front, raised up in a concrete cylinder. The plants in the garden are appearing and disappearing to make patterns. At one point they show a graph representing the successful implementation of a drinking fountain placed outside of the local amphitheater.<br />\nI&#8217;m fascinated by the plants existing and not existing at will and only the girl from the game breaks my concentration. She looks a little like Anne Hathaway only younger and prettier. We began walking together and she mentioned that I would get in trouble if I took her home because she was under 21. I thought that was a strange thing to say, since she was obviously over 18. I explained to her my open marriage and that it wasn&#8217;t a problem. My wife isn&#8217;t the jealous type.<br />\nShe became quite strange then and started opening up all kinds of personal firewalls. She told me how her friends would hate her if she ever got involved with a married man, open or not and that she couldn&#8217;t deal with her own life. I talked her down from hysteria, explaining that her friends didn&#8217;t control her life and if she felt so insecure around them, she needed knew friends. Again she opened up more and started talking about how downloading blog themes that related to suicide was a certain equivalent to a cry for help and she had already done that. She alluded that if she were to go home and be alone, she might not be around tomorrow.<br />\nI didn&#8217;t realize she would be such a broken friend but I took her home to see my wife and brother (Silas lived with us in a large house in this world).<br />\nOn the way there I tried to get the girl to use Skype. It&#8217;s wonderful, encrypted chat and phone calls, you can call me any time on it. Later in the house, I was carrying a little cup of half salt, half water. It was somehow a replacement for my phone but because of it&#8217;s lack of keys, I could only hear the other person&#8211;I couldn&#8217;t talk back&#8230;</p>\n",

    "title": "Melatonin or LCD?",
    "content": "<p>Last night, I took a two stage release Melatonin tablet at 23:00. Melatonin, is a neural transmitter produced in the pineal gland, used by the brain to regulate sleep cycles. This particular tablet releases .25mg 30 minutes after ingestion and then dispenses the remaining .75mg 3-4 hours later. Even though I went to bed at 00:20, I didn&#8217;t fall asleep until after 03:00. Even after the initial series of tossing and turning, it seemed I didn&#8217;t sleep at all. And yet, I feel quite well rested and I remember several vivid dreams.</p>\n<h3>The Dreams</h3>\n<p>Falling from a plane is not a good time when you don&#8217;t have a parachute. This I learned with 3 other army guys who all got shot up with something and shoved in the cargo bay of a high flying helicopter. After the machine began it&#8217;s long descent, we slipped out an opening and came to consciousness just as our gear belts caught on the railing. As we screamed at one another, against the furious force of the wind, a radio began to emit the cries of a friend. A friend was telling us that we might not die. There are parachutes behind the passenger seat. We just need to climb back up into the cockpit and retrieve them. And by the way, you only have 10,000ft before you go splat.<br />\nUpon reaching the cockpit, without a moment to spare, we discover that our assailants stripped the cockpit of anything useful. No shoots. No chance. What were we to do but ride out the fall? And we did, until we landed at a peculiar angle on the freeway. Going about the pace of traffic, we slid in and started to drive with it. Even in a traffic jam though, we couldn&#8217;t shake the feeling of inertia mixed with vertigo.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m walking through Ballard, only it&#8217;s not Ballard but some place I&#8217;ve never been. I&#8217;m exploring since I have no way of getting home and I decide to get lunch. Our kitten, Cassiopeia, is nestled upside down in the fold of my shirt, just around my waist. She looks up at me as I walk but is not disturbed by the motions. As I round into a pizza place, I pick Cassy out of her pouch and she becomes a baby. Suddenly much heavier and clothed, I sit at a counter stool next to a fairly attractive girl who&#8217;s ordering a vegan pizza. I too order a vegan pizza, with mushrooms, olives and bell peppers. Everyone loves the baby and wants to hold it. While I&#8217;m eating, the girl next to me asks if the baby is safe with that stranger over there. The stranger in question is a makeshift midget. His legs are severed below the knee and he wears shoes to cover the stumps. He&#8217;s slowly rolling the baby toward the door every time my eyes appear not to follow him.<br />\n&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. I&#8217;m watching.&#8221;<br />\nI walk over, crouched down, I extend my foot to keep the door closed, just as a patron tries to enter. That time, the door would have smacked the baby on the head. I reprimand the short man and return to the counter with the baby.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s quite a bit more, but I need to eat breakfast. After my shower, I half ejected a bit of morning bile. I managed to subdue it for the moment. I suspect some of my trouble sleeping last night was from dehydration. I suffered a bout of shortened breath and heat exhaustion from about 02:00-03:00. We&#8217;ll see how waking up at 06:30 works tomorrow. </p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I had a nasty fall today. Not something I ever expected. I didn&#8217;t even have my clumsy roller skate shoes on. I was just heading, rather quickly, to a car in the street and slipped on some wet grass. Next thing I know, I&#8217;m asleep, having a brief dream of working on my company. Then the dream shifts in an odd direction. I&#8217;m on the ground in the street and Daniel is talking to me, a cop next to him asking if I&#8217;m OK. I shake my head a bit. Bad dream; I need to wake up so I can get back to work.<br />\nNot so suddenly but rather in a subtle transition, I am finally convinced that I am no longer dreaming. The idea took some fighting. I wanted this to be part of my dream.<br />\n&#8220;The ambulance will be here soon, just relax.&#8221; This from the cop whose arm seems to be not on my shoulder but a part of it.<br />\n&#8220;How are you feeling?&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure who asked that. How am I feeling? In shock, I guess. I don&#8217;t know. I can&#8217;t feel much of anything. I just feel thick and heavy and I want to go back to sleep so I can wake up in my bed and shake off this whole dream.<br />\nThe ambulance gets there almost instantly. They check my spine and neck, asking if it hurts. No. I don&#8217;t think so. How can I tell? I&#8217;m a little preoccupied with what might have happened to my head. My jaw feels a little odd. My teeth don&#8217;t match up right. Is it broken? I can move my jaw, mostly. Can&#8217;t open it up all the way.<br />\nThe EMT pulls out a neck brace and tells me that I can&#8217;t keep it, even though it&#8217;s going to feel so comfortable. I&#8217;m so out of it, I don&#8217;t realize he&#8217;s making a joke. He seems to have a hard time putting the neck brace on me for a second and I worry that my neck might be broken. It takes a while for me to realize that the brace itself is just a misshapen noose with an akward strangle hold on my breathing apparatus. Then there&#8217;s the stretcher and the EMT explains that he&#8217;ll get in trouble if he doesn&#8217;t strap me to it.<br />\n&#8220;That&#8217;s ok, thanks. I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; I tell him.<br />\nNext thing I know, my forhead is strong taped to a hard plank. The rest of my body securely tightened as well. It&#8217;s hard to breath, mostly because of the brace.<br />\n&#8220;Do you want anything for the pain?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;m cold and I have to pee.&#8221; This is all I care about.<br />\n&#8220;Whose your doctor?&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t have one. I don&#8217;t have insurance.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Have you been to a hospital?&#8221;<br />\nI discount the dozens of hospitals I regularly visited before the age of 15. &#8220;Harborview, once, for strep. They didn&#8217;t charge me &#8217;cause I couldn&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Harborview is closed. What about Providence.&#8221; This last part is to somebody else.<br />\nWe end up at Swedish and before they admit me they have me sign a release and agreement to bill. it&#8217;s upside down and my writing wrist is nearly broken. My name looks like chicken scratch. &#8220;Bill that,&#8221; I think.</p>\n<p>They let me go after scanning my brain and my jaw. My jaw isn&#8217;t broken, one of my teeth just seems to be in a slightly different spot. No blood in my mouth. They checked. My brain seems fine&#8211;just the normal perversions and<br />\nimperfections.<br />\nUnfortunately, I didn&#8217;t manage to unlock the natural bind that prevents humans from having eidetic memory.<br />\n&#8220;An ice pack is your friend,&#8221; my doctor tells me. She&#8217;s kind. They all were. Next time an EMT asks me where to take my wounded body, I&#8217;ll say Swedish. Although, all they physically did for me was give me an ice pack. They gave me paperwork for sliding scale billing. We&#8217;ll see how much their arbitrary treatments will cost.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m off to bed now, a pocket of dried and semi-dried blood filling my sinus cavity.<br />\nI know not the headache I will have when I awaken, but in the meantime, I&#8217;ll sleep well and dream of not having a concussion.</p>\n",

They all liked to spar but they all had their own styles. I said I&#8217;d like to try out my hand against one of them. They weren&#8217;t hitting each other hard&#8211;it was just playful whacking.</p>\n<p>In the main room, a couple of them stood up and said they would challenge anyone with their Gung-Fu style. A slightly larger group stood up and posed in a horse stance with their fingers pointed out, &#8220;We will beat you with our Pointing Style.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Another larger group leaped off the ground and hovered in unison, all in lotus position with nothing but their index fingers holding them off the ground. &#8220;Feather Touch will destroy you all!&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The groups grew larger and more specialized and when everyone had set up for the fight, I realized I should get involved.</p>\n<p>I came crashing through the ceiling with a mighty afro hair style&#8211;somewhat mangled from going through the ceiling.

This was a strange university, I thought&#8211;I was only 8 minutes late. I lied to the principal, telling him I was a whole 5 minutes late and I thought the instructor would put me in a box. The principal looked concerned for my well being. He was a ragged man, appearing almost as a vagrant on the steps in one of the hallways. He ushered me to sit and told me to write a page about why I was late while he went to make excuses for me. I agreed and wrote about missing the bus. While writing, I reflected on what really happened.</p>\n<p>I was staying over at someone&#8217;s house, someone I didn&#8217;t know. We needed supplies for a full night of no sleep. We couldn&#8217;t sleep. We needed to fight off death. One of them had a special incantation for permanently warding off death but it involved never eating again for the rest of your life (which would be a long time). So we needed to go to the supermarket and buy munchies. We were going to enjoy our last meals.</p>\n<p>At the supermarket, there were thousands of people. It was like everyone wanted to have a last meal at once. There was an old woman about to eat a cracker at a sample station and I recognized her as being a past recipient of the death-ward. I tried to warn her that a cracker was not worth her life, but death swiveled through the biomass and aged her into extinction before I could even reach shouting distance.</p>\n<p>I was in a bank talking to an acquaintance of mine, a hacker that I had only met briefly at some convention or party. Somehow the topic of Python (the programming language) came up. I told him that I was intending to learn it since everyone I knew said it was the greatest thing since sliced perl modules. He disagreed:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Python isn&#8217;t that great. I took 3 undergrad classes on it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;You never found a use for it?&#8221; I queried.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Well, the blood key is a bit slow, you know. You should see the rendering, it&#8217;s just not that great.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what he meant but I knew I needed to get back to class. I had a betrayal to enact and I needed to do it soon or it would be too late.</p>\n<p>In the class room, we all sat in a circle on the floor. Everyone was either drugged up or spiritually hallucinating&#8211;unless there really was a holographic head sitting next to me. Everyone acted like zombies anyway&#8211;except for the Head, which was strangely coherent and commanding. It was the Head I was to betray.</p>\n<p>There was a game of sorts for which I was supposed to have a correct number of chits. Part of my subversive plan was that I had a pocket full of chits. I had all of them in fact. I laid out 24 of them and the Head looked around the room as people fished for theirs. He came back to me and began counting my chits.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have enough&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n<p>In my frantic worry about pulling off my plan, I had forgotten how many chits I was supposed to have. I needed to add more but not too many. I couldn&#8217;t reveal that I had so many in my pocket. I pulled out one and I could hear the clicking of the chit horde mixing in my pocket. Worried that someone else would hear, I pulled out a handful of chit parts. I had halves and quarters, thirds and bits. It was chaos. The Head freaked but it was too late. I had delivered my message clear and his downfall was imminent. *that part didn&#8217;t make sense to me in the dream or in real life but it worked*</p>\n",

You took a bird, one of those new bright four legged parakeets. As part of the ritual, you punctured it's back, quickly with a pen, and handed it to me. \"Throw it in the trash\", you said.<br />\nIt wasn't moving, but the hole in it's side wasn't bleeding either. It was just a hollowed out  spot.<br />\nThe trash was full and I thought I should write the date on the birds skin--for documentation. It's skin made for an easy drawing surface, and right next to the hole, I scrawled \"2004/\". The bird started to shiver. <em>It's not dead</em>. I kept writing, \"2004/10/\". <em>What day is it?</em> I couldn't focus with all of the shaking in my hands. I could feel the bird panic.<em> Is it the 13th, 14th?. God, if only it would calm down.</em>. After I settled on writing the date as the 13th of October, the bird tried to run out of my hand. It's front legs were very able and it grasped my fingers, inching forward.<br />\nWhen I grabbed it at the head, I realized that it was bleeding and hadn't very long left to live. It's eyes looked like a cats and held enough familiarity to make me very sad. It was crying, but the tears were mine. I awoke before it died.\"</span></p>\n",

Luckily, there were cop comment stations every hundred meters for situations as common as this. The cop followed me to fill out his side of the story. He had a carbon copy form of which I was to take the messy page. In a stack of comment cards, I tried to find one with his name on it but they all had the name of one particular cop whom somehow we both knew. The files were dated all the way back to 1932, which we found odd since the officer in question was in his mid-twenties. The offending cop shrugged at me and crossed out the other officer&#8217;s name. As I was filling out a report, I noticed a couple of kids spraying graffiti just a few meters away. The cop didn&#8217;t notice as I tried to distract him with lame conversation about sports and weather (neither about which I knew anything).</p>\n",

All versions of Windows from 95-XP (including NT and 2K) are affected by this exploit.<br />\nWhen Microsoft finally fixes this problem, you can uninstall this patch.</p>\n<p><b>Exploit details:</b></p>\n<p>Windows *.wmf files are a scripted image format similar to scalable vector graphics (*.svg). Unfortunately, these files do not need to be named with the .wmf extension for windows to execute them so any file on any web page or attachment or floating around in a worm may contain executable .wmf code.<br />\nThe simple exploit takes advantage of a built in error function execution in .wmf files. If the .wmf file has an error (can&#8217;t be rendered for some reason&#8211;such as intentional poor coding), Windows will automatically execute whatever error function is built into that file. This function can contain any malicious code that the creator wishes and allows transparent installation of malware such as Trojans, spyware, key loggers, etc&#8230;</p>\n<p><b>Patch Details:</b></p>\n<p>The patch (<a href=\"http://www.hexblog.com/index.html\">http://www.hexblog.com/index.html</a>) simply installs a .dll, which prevents the error function execution by removing it from the Windows metafile handler. It will not affect the system in any visible or functional way besides preventing this unnecessary feature.</p>\n",

When I stepped up to him, he produced a dull knife and hammered it into my chest. It didn&#8217;t pierce the leather jacket I was wearing so I grabbed his head and twisted him around. He still managed to prod me with the blade again and this time it cut through slightly. I let him go and started to walk away but he stabbed me in the back, just under my left arm. My jacket protected me for the most part but I could feel a little blood warming my side. He just stood there and I tried to rip the knife from his hands. The blade broke in two pieces and he started to laugh. Somehow, I was left holding the two halfs while he ran away.<br />\nIt was late and dark and I was in the part of town you don&#8217;t want to be in with somebody else&#8217;s broken knife. Throwing the pieces in two seperate places, I climbed up onto a roof to hide. A patrolman was coming with a flashlight and I didn&#8217;t want to be seen. On the roof was a little shack, which I crawled into and took a nap on a makeshift bed someone had left there. I awoke to dropletts of rain, falling from the shoddy roof of the shack and to the sound of the door starting to open. I jumped up, intending to lock the door but it was too late. The kind face of a slightly elderly man poked in from the other side. He didn&#8217;t seem to hold any ill will toward my intrusion on his shack. I let him in and apologized. He sat at a desk, which I hadn&#8217;t noticed before. He began to type on an old Remington and it produced a pleasing tack and clang. The old man explained that he was a writer. He had been a writer his whole life but only recently had he truly written. This rooftop shack was now his home, his escape from his previous life, a small salvation for a dying artist.<br />\nWhen he realized that I was invited to a prestigious dinner party, which took place later that night, he begged me to bring him along. He desired to interview someone at the event for an environmentalist paper he was to publish. I didn&#8217;t know the person he wanted to talk to but I said he could come along anyway.<br />\nIt was an extremely expensive party, with all kinds of dancing, food, deceit and decadence. I lost track of the man from the shack and soon felt it was time to go home.</p>\n",

Someone was following me with sinister intent so I took evasive action. After turning a corner, I ran up the next block and backtracked around. My destination was close. Around the next bend, I banged on the glass door of an office, which had all of it&#8217;s blinds drawn shut. It was late and the office was closed but I knew the owner was inside. I had something important to tell him and he needed my help. When he answered the door, I bolted inside and explained that I had someone on my tail.<br />\n&#8220;You scared me half to death,&#8221; he wandered back to another room where he had been playing Soul Reaver, a playstation game. He had a very large monitor, which made the game look life-like. To add to the effect, all of his lights were out and he had some creepy movie playing in the living room.<br />\nI looked at him and around the place, waving my arms in exhaustion. &#8220;It looks like you scared yourself.&#8221;<br />\nHe took me into a back room and showed me a huge statue. &#8220;You&#8217;re tail is after this. We have to move it but moving it would destroy it.&#8221;<br />\nSomehow, we got off topic and I started talking about new things going on in the world. &#8220;Technology is really moving forward quickly. The other day, I saw a no wheel skateboard in the window of that shop. Some sort of hover tech.&#8221;<br />\n&#8220;Really? Show me.&#8221;<br />\nI took the scientist down to the skate shop and we looked around. &#8220;It was here the other day. Let me ask someone&#8230;&#8221;<br />\nI found a store clerk but he was the opposite of helpful. He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m a little kid who likes cartoons. I haven&#8217;t seen every cartoon. Got any candy? If I were you, I&#8217;d go downstairs and join the parade. Skate battle starts at 9am sharp. You&#8217;ve got a few minutes.&#8221;<br />\nWe went downstairs, which was actually a huge skate ramp. The &#8220;skate battle&#8221; looked more like a winter ball. Couples were waltzing in fancy clothes and we skated around them (having somehow aquired boards along the way).<br />\nWhen we exited the shop, we were suddenly high up on a balcony of some extremely tall building. The walkway wrapped around and we found that we were looking over a world class soccer game. Across the field, about as high as we were, sat a group of obvious undercover police men. We acted casual, passing a clipboard back and forth, while my cohort fiddled with a pocket PC. The clipboard didn&#8217;t have anything important on it, but the pocket PC was a remote control for a weapon of some kind.<br />\nZooming in on the police, I could hear one of them saying, &#8220;You know, while we pass these binoculars back and forth and they pass that clipboard back and forth, it&#8217;s likely that that clipboard is just a distraction. They are probably just throwing us off the tracks of the real issue.&#8221; Then my partner bit the tip of his pocket PC, stretching out a large antennae. Giant balloons started to grow from it&#8217;s tip and they floated upward, full of hydrogen. &#8220;This is it. This marks the creation of zero point energy. We&#8217;ve done it.&#8221; It was too late. The cops couldn&#8217;t do anything about it. We had created free energy out of hydrogen balloons and misdirection.</p>\n",

We ate chips and salsa, then I had some chicken tenders at IHOP while Lena sobered up to drive us home. By the time we got home, it was bedtime and I could still taste the food we had recently consumed.<br />\nWhen I awoke this morning, I felt like I had indulged in a few drinks&#8211;even though I didn&#8217;t.<br />\nI&#8217;ve read that eating within 3 hours of bedtime is not very healthy. I suspect this is the case only with monophasic schedules though. When I was on the polyphasic system, I found that eating before a nap was practical and easy, without the side effects of feeling hung-over.<br />\nThe reason for the hung over feeling has to do with deep sleep slowing down digestion to almost nothing. So, if a person sleeps for 6 hours straight (as I did last night), food just sits partially digested. Not a very pleasant thing to wake up to. However, when I was only sleeping for 20-40 minutes, it didn&#8217;t have much of an impact (if any) on the digestion process.<br />\nI&#8217;ve also noticed a distinct difficulty remembering my dreams on days when I wake up with the grogginess of a late night meal.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>I was working for this large software company and I had to go into the office for some reason. Outside, in the parking lot, dozens of scanner drones flew around, identifying anyone within walking distance of the building. I was scanned at least half a dozen times. When I entered the lobby, Lena was there. She needed to do something for school and I was wondering how she could get in without an ID badge. They were very strict about access. No card, no entry. I checked my wallet, hoping I could scan us both in but I couldn&#8217;t find my ID card. I opened pockets that I didn&#8217;t even know I had but it was nowhere to be found.<br />\n&#8220;Looks like we&#8217;ll have to sneak in,&#8221; I told Lena.<br />\nOne other security measure for that day was that everyone who entered had to be wearing a special T-shirt. The company had just launched a new product, so everyone had a black shirt with the company logo and the name of the new software. Two girls at the front desk handed us a couple of shirts and said we should put them on outside. We started to leave but they called after us, &#8220;if you&#8217;re going to change in your car, you should take one of the couches by the main entrance. You can carry in out and haul it up the stairs to the parking lot. Just bring it back when you&#8217;re finished.&#8221; I thought about this idea of hers and realized there was no need to do what she suggested.<br />\n&#8220;We&#8217;re not taking one of your couches.&#8221; They would have none of it and we had to lose ourselves in the crowd in order to escape.<br />\nWe went to my car to change and when we were finished, Lena suggested we check on our backpacks that were in her car a few blocks away. That was a good idea since earlier there was some strange guy eyeballing our stuff when she parked it there. We hopped in my car and sped out of the lot, a scanner drone chasing us and blaring sirens to identify ourselves. We went faster. It only chased us a couple of blocks. Lena checked the car and came back with the news that our bags with our laptops had been stolen. Although, she didn&#8217;t say it right out. She said, &#8220;I heard theft increases 54% after the first time.&#8221; I knew by that statement that it was gone.<br />\nDissapointed, we went to my old work place, a bar, to have a drink. Some friendly acquaintances asked me whey they couldn&#8217;t log into my file server. They were having all kinds of issues with it. I wrote down my IP address for one of them and he asked me to also write down the IP address of Yahoo mail because he wanted to do some hacking. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know the yahoo IP addresses off the top of my head. You can look them up though.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t seem satisfied.</p>\n<p>Dang. I do need to wake up earlier. I&#8217;m just getting started but I have to eat breakfast and get out of here. I meant to wake up at 6am (that was when my laptop got stolen and I woke myself up to feel better that it was just a dream, knowing that my laptop was right downstairs).</p>\n",

I was back in high school, visiting. Around lunch time, this horde of people with sumo suits and party gear were waiting for the students to come out to the quad (our communal lunch field). This had happened once when I was in high school. It was an elaborate ploy to get kids to come to a lecture on Jesus. Needless to say, I was once again horrified. The man who was in charge noticed that I was glaring at him and when he came over to deliver his sales pitch, I told him off. The biggest problem I had with this group in high school (other than the fact that they held a religious sermon at a public school, which goes against my beliefs of seperation of church and state) was that they never told anyone what was going to happen at the &#8220;party&#8221; everyone was invited to. It&#8217;s a small town. If there&#8217;s a party, people will go without asking what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s the weekness of the uninitiated. So, as all the students came out of the class rooms and saw what waited for them, I screamed out the truth, &#8220;it&#8217;s a hoax! they just want to preach to you. This is a church promotion&#8230;&#8221; and so on.</p>\n<p>Later on in my dream, I was riding a very small (and thin) skateboard to get to school. I had missed too many classes and I didn&#8217;t do any of my homework this week so I was worried that I would miss even more. The reason I was riding the skateboard was because my motorcycle, which I don&#8217;t have in real life, had broken down. On my way, I came across a truck that was for sale. Curious, I opened it up and crawled inside to check out the interior. It was huge. While I was inside, the owner came around and asked what I was up to. I said I just wanted to check it out and he started telling me all about everything that was wrong with it. Somehow, it still seemed cool. Probably because it had a couch inside, which still left it with a livingroom sized interior.</p>\n<p>There was a lot more but I&#8217;ve gotta get ready to go. Maybe I need to wake up earlier so I&#8217;m not so groggy.<br />\nI noticed, when I was on the plan, that I could eat at any time&#8211;even right before bed. Now, if I eat within 3 hours of bedtime, I wake up really groggy. </p>\n",

I don&#8217;t believe this is true. The best way, and sometimes the only way, for me to sleep is to dream my way asleep. I try to focus on blurring out my surroundings while formulating some visual scene about the fuzzyness around me. On my most recent nap, I kept sliding in and out of deep sleep. I must have shifted 6 or 7 times. It felt like an enormous sine wave, what seemed like fully awake at one end and REM at the other, neither lasting very long. </p>\n<p>There were these two beings, human like, although I didn&#8217;t get a close look. I was too busy focusing on the two colossal gladiators they were worshiping as gods. These gladiators were almost robots, huge bulbous metalic helmets, reflecting shards of light placed around there heads. On closer inspection, the helmets were domes holding hundreds of thousands of people, as if these giant beings had each swooped up a football stadium full of bloodthirsty fans and kindly wrapped a glass ceiling to cover them. Then it became clear that all of these dome dwellers were worshiping the two tiny people on the ground.<br />\nThe small ground people worshiped the giants because of their magnificent size difference. The giants were full of people just like them who looked out and saw two unworldly beings, which they delighted to concieve of as Gods.<br />\nMentally, I wavered between the two groups, zooming in and out&#8211;a dizzying thing to do when you are bobbing up and down the sine wave of sleep. I couldn&#8217;t be sure if I should focus on the absurdity of the two people on the ground or the countless people in the domes. They both seemed so silly, although, in retrospect, the people on the ground seem rightly less silly. I would certainly marvel at two enormous beings of any kind if they towered so high over me, even if I knew they were full of people (though, the groundlings clearly did not have that knowledge).</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I had many other detailed dreams and I remained lucid throughout all of them. I even remember a moment of paralysis, which I believe was my body entering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REM_sleep\" target=\"_blank\">REM</a>. I&#8217;ve read that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedunculopontine_nucleus\" target=\"_blank\">Pedunculopontine nucleus</a> is the supposed (but not proven) main trigger of REM, which also halts motor functions at that stage of sleep.</p>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;d tell you more, but I&#8217;ve got to get to class.</p>\n",

I turned off the alarm and while part of me was thinking, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just lay here and remember my dream for a minute&#8221;, I know another part of me was thinking, &#8220;hey, daylight savings&#8230; I get an extra hour. I may as well sleep.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So I did and I didn&#8217;t wake up until 8am (7am after daylight savings).<br />\nThe worst part is that I don&#8217;t even feel like I got a full night of sleep.<br />\nMy body feels so sore and tired.<br />\nBut I&#8217;m not giving up.

    "content": "<p>I&#8217;m drinking a cup of licorice tea to subside a slight bit of nausea.<br />\nSo, this is day 3 and I just got up at 5am. My plan to sleep from midnight to 3am has been shifted a little, in part by my lack of ability to manage daytime napping. I was too busy at work yesterday and skipped 2 of my vital daytime naps, which meant I was awake from 8:45am-5:30pm (8.75 hours). I sort of justified this because I slept from 12am-4:30am yesterday morning (1.5 hours over my original schedule). It was much easier to nap on the bus yesterday. For my morning bus to work (8am-8:45am), I crashed hard and got a good 30 minutes of deep sleep. Then, heading to school from work (5:30-5:45), I again slept hard. Luckily, both times, I slept all the way up to the point of my stop, naturally waking up when my body felt it was time. I&#8217;ve had little trouble with sleeping on the bus over the years. I&#8217;m glad I haven&#8217;t offset my bodies clock too much yet. We&#8217;ll see how the next couple of weeks fare.</p>\n<p>Last night I got 4.5 hours of core sleep as well. I expect because I missed so much sleep during the day. There is no school or work for me for the next 3 days, so there is no reason I should miss my naps today through Sunday.</p>\n<p>I did find it easy to focus on work and research yesterday but I don&#8217;t know if it was just adrenaline and excitement rather than a benefit of napping. It&#8217;s too early to tell.</p>\n<p>I did some interesting reading yesterday. Found a book called the &#8220;Encyclopedia of Sleeping&#8221; at my school library.</p>\n<p>Here is the research info I gathered from this book:</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement\" target=\"_blank\">REM:</a></b><br />\nREM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is largely still not understood. We know little about it from human testing and have found that deprived of REM for 3-8 weeks, rats suffer death. This does not seem to happen in animals when deprived of other stages of sleep. However, some non-predatory animals such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle-nosed_dolphin\" target=\"_blank\">Bottle-nosed Dolphin</a>, experience <b>no REM</b> during sleep.<br />\nDuring REM, which lasts usually lasts 90-120 minutes in adult humans, neurons in the brain continuously release the same neurotransmitters that are constantly released during waking time (seratonin, histamine, and neropinephrine).  the human brain. The release of this neurotransmitters is decreased during NREM.<br />\nBecause REM sleep is so similar to being awake, it is much easier to wake from REM. People who are woken up during NREM feel groggy and sometimes nauseous (as I felt this morning&#8211;I think I was in the wrong stage).<br />\n<b>popular theory of the need for REM:</b><br />\nNervous system development and maintenance.<br />\nHere&#8217;s an interesting research paper on REM dealing with memory:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.vertes.html\" target=\"_blank\">THE CASE AGAINST MEMORY CONSOLIDATION IN REM SLEEP</a></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NREM\" target=\"_blank\">NREM:</a></b><br />\nThere are 4 NREM stages before REM sets in. NREM stands simply for Non-REM sleep. Stage one is the most lucid stage, where people feel awake. In the second stage, muscles are spontaneously stressed and relaxed, heart rate slows and the body cools. the 3rd and 4th stages of NREM are deep sleep called &#8220;slow-wave&#8221; or delta <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep\" target=\"_blank\">sleep</a>.<br />\n<b>popular theory of the need for NREM:</b><br />\nSince neurotransmitter release activity almost vanishes in NREM, some people hypothosize that the purpose of NREM is to keep the human brain from becoming desensitized to those vital chemicals. </p>\n<p><b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norepinephrine\" target=\"_blank\">Norepinephrine:</a></b><br />\nAlso known as noradrenaline, this is a neurotransmitter, which increases efficiency of signal processing throughout the nervous system (by increasing neural response while reducing the level of background noise. Uninterrupted release would cause a gradual degradation (reduced sensitivity) of the system. Easing up on the production of norepinephrine the only factual benefit I&#8217;ve found for NREM on the human mind.</p>\n<p><b>REM Latency:</b><br />\nThis is the duration of the 4 stages of NREM sleep before REM sets in. Normal REM latency for adult humans is 100 minutes or longer (in a standard monophasic sleep night).<br />\nBaby humans have almost no REM Latency (NREM)  sleep. Elderly humans also naturally decrease there NREM sleep time to approximately 60 minutes. I have not found a reason for this.<br />\nREM latency increasing is one of the main effects of anti-depressive and narcolepsy drugs. </p>\n<p>Well, I&#8217;ve got to eat. I&#8217;m going to cycle off to the store and get some broccoli. Steamed, salted broccoli sounds like the only thing I could eat right now. My stomach always feels a little quesy when I&#8217;m sleep deprived. Hopefully, with a lack of complete REM cycles, I won&#8217;t lose my motor skills and go crashing off into something 8^\\/</p>\n<p><b>Today&#8217;s Schedule Goal:</b><br />\n(after waking at 5am from 12:30am bedtime)<br />\n<font family=\"courier\"><br />\n05:00-10:00 = 5 hours awake<br />\n10:00-10:20 = 20 min nap<br />\n10:20-15:20 = 5 hours awake<br />\n15:20-15:40 = 20 min nap<br />\n15:40-19:40 = 4 hours awake<br />\n19:40-20:00 = 20 min nap<br />\n20:00-24:00 = 4 hours awake</p>\n<p>core sleep 00:00-03:00 (to get back on track)<br />\n</font></p>\n",

Needing a research paper topic for my English class, I decided to try out a new sleeping cycle. I&#8217;ve always wanted to figure out a more natural sleep rhythm than the monophasic blocks, which have never been my forte to begin with. Having a very busy schedule, I need more hours in the day. Normally, I wake up at 7am. I spend an hour taking a shower and eating, checking my email and packing up food for the day. Then I catch a 45 minute bus downtown to work from 9am-5pm (approximately&#8211;my schedule is a bit more complex than this but it will suffice). After work, I go immediately to school (20 minute bus ride) where I stay until 8pm-9pm. I then take another 40 minute bus ride back home. Normally, I would get about 6-7 hours of sleep at home and then I&#8217;d nap on the bus. If I can manage to cut my daily sleep down to 3-4 hours a day, I would have an extra 3-4 hours each day (or 21-28 hours per week). I&#8217;m going to use this time to document my experiment in this blog, do my homework and start writing a book&#8211;not on this subject :)</p>\n<p><b>Summary:</b><br />\nPolyphasic Sleep is a system of limiting daily sleep time to 2-5 hours by taking a 20-45 minute nap every four hours. People who practice this technique claim to be more alert and healthier than ever before. Little scientific experimentation has been done on polyphasic sleeping. However, throughout history, many brilliant minds have practiced and enjoyed its benefits. Leonardo da Vinci and Buckminster Fuller used this exact method and, while continually astonishing the world with brilliance, both lived double the expected life spans of their times. Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison experimented with similar sleep patterns throughout their most inventive phases.<br />\nSome people are still skeptical of splitting daily sleep into several sections as it goes against the social norm and, with lack of scientific proof, they cannot be certain of its effects. Doctors warn that lack of sleep can be fatally harmful, which is one reason people are reluctant to experiment with it. Polyphasic sleeping can also be difficult to practice for people running regular daytime schedules or working full 8-9 hour shifts. The question then is this: What are the real benefits or detriments of polyphasic sleeping? I expect to find that although difficult to manage and maintain, polyphasic sleeping allows a person to be more cognitively alert during waking hours while having many more waking hours to spend.</p>\n<p>So yesterday evening (or the day before yesterday), I made a schedule for myself. I figured I should ease into this program by taking a <b>big nap</b> (3 hours) from midnight to 3am, then stay awake until my bus ride to work where I could sleep for 40 minutes. After that, I could take a nap break at work and sleep again on the bus coming home at night.</p>\n<p><b>Schedule</b><br />\n<font family=\"courier\">2005.10.24<br />\n23:15 -> (awake since 07:15 = 16 hours = 960 minutes)<br />\nThis is when I decided to start my new cycle &#8212; too late to take an extra nap :)</p>\n<p>2005.10.25</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tr>\n<th>Time (24 hour)</th>\n<th>Minutes</th>\n<th>State</th>\n<th>Activity</th>\n</tr>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#dddddd\">\n<td>00:00-03:00</td>\n<td>180</td>\n<td>Sleeping</td>\n<td>home-bed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03:00-07:00</td>\n<td>240</td>\n<td>Awake</td>\n<td>homework</td>\n</tr>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#dddddd\">\n<td>07:00-07:40</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>Sleeping</td>\n<td>bus to work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07:40-10:40</td>\n<td>180</td>\n<td>Awake</td>\n<td>work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#dddddd\">\n<td>10:40-11:00</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>Sleeping</td>\n<td>nap at work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11:00-14:30</td>\n<td>195</td>\n<td>Awake</td>\n<td>work</td>\n</tr>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#dddddd\">\n<td>14:45-15:15</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>Sleeping</td>\n<td>chair at school</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15:15-21:00</td>\n<td>345</td>\n<td>Awake</td>\n<td>classes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr bgcolor=\"#dddddd\">\n<td>21:00-21:40</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>Sleeping</td>\n<td>bus to home</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21:40-24:00</td>\n<td>140</td>\n<td>Awake</td>\n<td>homework</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></font><br />\nOverall, I think it went well for the first day (yesterday). It wasn&#8217;t easy to sleep on the buses, which is odd because I usually konk right out on the bus. I figured it was an adrenaline issue.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this morning, I woke up a bit late. It was 4am when I woke up, so I figured I should sleep another 30 minutes to get the rest of my full 90 minute cycle.</p>\n<p>Right now, I&#8217;m eating while writing this entry. Now that I have formulated a fairly rigid schedule, I&#8217;m going to try to eat more regularly.<br />\nI&#8217;ve been surviving mostly on dried fruit and nuts, Cliff bars and juice&#8211;with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for breakfast.</p>\n<p><b>Meal:</b><br />\nPeanut Butter and Jelly sandwich (Adam&#8217;s Peanut Butter + Trader Joes &#8211; reduced sugar &#8211; blueberry preserves + Franz &#8220;Redwood Forest&#8221; Flax &#038; Grains bread<br />\n100% pure grape juice<br />\n<b>Vitamins:</b><br />\nFlaxseed oil [1000 mg]<br />\nAcidophilus [10 mg]<br />\nGinko Biloba [500 mg]<br />\nGlucosamine Sulfate [500mg]<br />\nCalcium [300 mg]<br />\nMagnesium [130 mg]<br />\nZinc [10 mg]</p>\n",
